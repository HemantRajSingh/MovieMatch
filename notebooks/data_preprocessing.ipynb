      "['Shouting \"Roma Invicta!\" as his forces attack, General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) leads the Roman Army to victory against Germanic barbarians in the year 180 A.D., ending a prolonged war and earning the esteem of elderly Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Although the dying Aurelius has a son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), he decides to appoint temporary leadership to the morally-upstanding Maximus, with a desire to eventually return power to the Roman Senate. Aurelius informs Maximus and offers him time to consider before informing Commodus, who, in a bout of jealousy, murders his father.Declaring himself the emperor, Commodus asks Maximus for his loyalty, which Maximus, realizing Commodus\\' involvement in the Emperor\\'s death, refuses. Commodus orders Maximus\\' execution and dispatches Praetorian Guards to murder Maximus\\' wife and son. Maximus narrowly escapes his execution and races home only to discover his family\\'s charred and crucified bodies in the smoldering ruins of his villa. After burying his wife and son, a grieving Maximus succumbs to exhaustion and collapses on their graves.Slave traders find Maximus and take him to Zucchabar, a rugged province in North Africa, where he is purchased by Proximo, the head of a local gladiator school. Distraught and nihilistic over the death of his family and betrayal by his empire, Maximus initially refuses to fight, but as he defends himself in the arena his formidable combat skills lead to a rise in popularity with the audience. As he trains and fights further, Maximus befriends Hagen, a Germanic barbarian, and Juba, a Numidian hunter, the latter becoming a close friend and confidant to the grieving Maximus, the two speaking frequently of the afterlife and Maximus\\' eventual reunification with his family.In Rome, Commodus reopens the gladiatorial games to commemorate his father\\'s death, and Proximo\\'s company of gladiators are hired to participate. In a recreation of the Battle of Zama (incorrectly named the Battle of Carthage) at the Colosseum, Maximus leads Proximo\\'s gladiators to decisive victory against a more powerful force, much to the amazement of the crowd. Commodus descends into the arena to meet the victors and is stunned to discover Maximus as the leader of Proximo\\'s gladiators. The Emperor, unable to kill Maximus because of the crowd\\'s roaring approval for him, sulks out of the arena.As the games continue, Commodus pits Maximus against Tigris of Gaul, Rome\\'s only undefeated gladiator, in an arena surrounded by chained tigers with handlers instructed to target Maximus. Following an intense battle, Maximus narrowly defeats Tigris and awaits Commodus\\' decision to kill or spare Tigris. As Commodus votes for death, Maximus spares Tigris, deliberately insulting the Emperor and garnering the audience\\'s approval. His bitter enemy now known as \"Maximus the Merciful,\" Commodus becomes more frustrated at his inability to kill Maximus or stop his ascending popularity while Commodus\\' own popularity shrinks.Following the fight, Maximus meets his former servant Cicero, who reveals that Maximus\\'s army remains loyal to him. They are camped at the port Ostia. Maximus forms a plot with Lucilla, Commodus\\' sister, and Senator Gracchus to reunite Maximus with his army and overthrow Commodus. Commodus however, suspecting his sister\\'s betrayal, threatens her young son and forces her to reveal the plot. Praetorian guards immediately storm Proximo\\'s gladiator barracks, battling the gladiators while Maximus escapes. Hagen and Proximo are killed in the siege while Juba and the survivors are imprisoned. Maximus escapes to the city walls only to witness Cicero\\'s death and be ambushed by a legion of Praetorian guards.Concluding that legends born in the Colosseum must die there, Commodus personally challenges Maximus to a duel in front of a roaring audience. Acknowledging that Maximus\\' skill exceeds his own, Commodus deliberately stabs Maximus with a stiletto, puncturing his lung, and has the wound concealed beneath the gladiator\\'s armor. In the arena, the two exchange blows before Maximus rips the sword from Commodus\\'s hands. Commodus requests a sword from his guards, but they betray him and refuse to lend him their weapons. Maximus drops his own sword, but Commodus pulls a hidden stiletto and renews his attack. Maximus then beats Commodus into submission and kills him with his own stiletto.As Commodus collapses in the now-silent Colosseum, a dying Maximus begins seeing his wife and son in the afterlife. He reaches for them but is pulled back to reality by the Praetorian prefect Quintus, who asks for instructions. Maximus orders the release of Proximo\\'s gladiators and Senator Gracchus, whom he reinstates and instructs to return Rome to a Senate-based government.Maximus collapses, and Lucilla rushes to his aid. After being reassured that her son is safe and Commodus is dead, Maximus dies and wanders into the afterlife to his family in the distance. Senator Gracchus and Proximo\\'s gladiators carry his body out of the Colosseum. That night, a newly freed Juba buries Maximus\\' two small statues of his wife and son in the Colosseum, and says that he too will eventually join them, but not yet.'\n",
      " 'Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man whose short term memory is damaged when he is struck in the head while confronting two people who are attacking his wife. Leonard kills one of the attackers and one of the last things Leonard remembers is his wife dying. Leonard then devotes his life to finding and killing the second attacker.The movie has color and black and white sequences. The black & white sequences proceed in chronological order, the color sequences are in reverse chronological order.Leonard wakes up in a room at Discount Inn puzzled. An unknown caller calls. Leonard says that he suffers from Anterograde amnesia, a condition which makes him unable to create new memories. He describes the condition by detailing the story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky).Leonard has a system of notes to bring him up to speed every time his memory resets. Leonard\\'s tattoo: \"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE\" as well as other clues tattooed on his body.Leonard was an insurance investigator & investigated Sammy. Sammy\\'s claim was denied as the company classified his symptoms as mental. Mrs Jankins tried to convince Leonard, but he didn\\'t change his opinion. She went into a coma & never recovered & Sammy went to a mental hospital.The unknown caller talks about how police never believed Leonard\\'s story of a second attacker. The caller says he is a cop & provides additional clues. Leonard tattoos the fact the 2nd attacker was a drug dealer, Jimmy Grantz and tells Leonard that he has set up a meeting with Jimmy. Leonard agrees to meet the caller in the motel lobby.In the lobby, Leonard meets (Joe Pantoliano) \"Officer Gammell\". Gammel says that Leonard should call him \"Teddy\" since he is \"undercover\". Teddy sends Leonard to an abandoned building. When Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden) arrives, he recognizes Leonard as the man with the memory condition. Leonard threatens Jimmy. Jimmy pleads & tells Leonard that there is $200,000 in the trunk of his car for payment of the drugs that Teddy was to have brought to the meeting. Leonard strangles Jimmy, takes a Polaroid photo of his body, and starts putting on Jimmy\\'s clothes. As the photo of Jimmy\\'s body develops, the film gradually goes from black and white into color.As Leonard drags Jimmy into the basement, he hears Jimmy whisper \"Sammy...\" before dying. Leonard concludes that if Jimmy knew about Sammy, he was not the second attacker.Teddy arrives & finally admits that Jimmy Grantz was a drug dealer who did not have anything to do with his wife\\'s killing. Teddy tells Leonard that his wife survived the attack. he says, Sammy Jankis was a fraud who was not even married and it was Leonard\\'s wife who was diabetic. Teddy claims to be the police officer who investigated his wife\\'s murder. He says he believed him about the second attacker and helped him track down and kill the real John G. more than a year ago. Teddy claims that he took a picture of a happy Leonard right after the second attacker was dead. Leonard forgot the killing and began searching for the dead John G. all over again. Teddy tells Leonard there are plenty of John Gs to find and admits that he is even a John G: his full name is John Edward Gammell and his mother calls him Teddy.Before Lenny can forget, he decides to continue the hunt, lying to himself to set himself up to kill Teddy. He records a note on Teddy\\'s photo \"Don\\'t believe his lies\", records Teddy\\'s license plate number as John G\\'s, and leaves himself a reminder to get a tattoo of the plate number, SG137IU. Leonard ditches Teddy by throwing Teddy\\'s car keys into some weeds. Leonard then leaves his pickup truck at the refinery and drives away in Jimmy\\'s Jaguar, still wearing Jimmy\\'s clothes.After forgetting Teddy\\'s revelations and the lies to himself, Leonard finds a tattoo parlor and has the license plate number tattooed onto his leg. Teddy sees the Jaguar parked outside and comes in, trying to move the car and get Lenny to get out of town in some new clothes. Leonard sees the note on the back of Teddy\\'s pictures and decides to leave without him.Leonard finds a note in the pocket of Jimmy\\'s suit coat, which he is wearing. The note is from a Natalie telling Jimmy to come to Ferdy\\'s bar. Not realizing he is wearing Jimmy\\'s clothes and driving Jimmy\\'s car, Leonard thinks the note is for him and goes to meet Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). He tells her about his condition. Natalie believes his story after a test.Natalie takes Leonard to her home and tells him he can stay with her. Leonard recounts what he remembers of the attack. He says he awoke to sounds, got a gun, and found his wife (Jorja Fox) being strangled. Leonard shot one intruder, but a second man clubbed him with a sap and smashed his head into a mirror. He goes on to explain that the cops did not believe there was a second attacker. Leonard tells Natalie that the second attacker was too smart and left the evidence to look like there was only one intruder.Natalie tricks Leonard into going after a man named Dodd (Callum Keith Rennie), who she claims has been harassing her for the money from Jimmy\\'s prior drug deals. Leonard leaves to look for Dodd. Teddy is waiting for him as he leaves Natalie\\'s home. Teddy tries to warn Leonard about Natalie, but after seeing the \"Don\\'t believe his lie\" note on Teddy\\'s picture does not believe him. Leonard does decide he shouldn\\'t stay with Natalie and follows Teddy\\'s advice to go to the Discount Inn.Leonard goes to the Discount Inn. Burt (Mark Boone Junior) at the front desk takes advantage of his condition by renting him a second room even though he had already paid for a first room. Leonard calls an escort service. When the escort arrives, Leonard explains to her that he wants only to relive going to sleep the night of the attack. After falling asleep, the escort wakes him. He asks the escort to leave. He then takes personal items belonging to his wife to a reservoir and burns them.In the morning, Leonard leaves the reservoir and is spotted by Dodd. Leonard escapes Dodd and goes to Dodd\\'s motel to wait for him. When Dodd returns to his motel room, Leonard beats him and ties him up. Leonard calls Teddy for help in dealing with Dodd. Teddy comes to Dodd\\'s motel room. Leonard and Teddy convince Dodd to leave town.Returning the favor of getting rid of Dodd, Leonard spends the night at Natalie\\'s. In the morning she agrees to trace the license plate number tattooed on Leonard\\'s leg. Later that day, Natalie gives him the information along with directions to \"an abandoned place outside of town\" where a guy she knew \"used to do bigger deals\". Leonard takes it back to his motel. At the motel, Leonard puts the clues together and concludes that Teddy is John Edward Gammell and must be the second attacker. He calls Teddy and they go to the same abandoned building where Jimmy Grantz was killed a few days earlier. Leonard then shoots Teddy in the head.'\n",
      " 'After stealing an 86-carat (17 g) diamond in a heist in Antwerp, Frankie \"Four-Fingers\" (Benicio Del Toro) goes to London to deliver the gemstone to diamond dealer Doug \"The Head\" (Mike Reid) on behalf of New York jeweler \"Cousin Avi\" (Dennis Farina), who bankrolled the theft. One of the other robbers advises Frankie to first see his arms-dealing brother, ex-KGB agent Boris \"The Blade\" (Rade Serbedzija), to obtain a gun. Unbeknownst to Frankie, the brothers plan to rob him of the diamond, using a third party to avoid implicating themselves.Meanwhile, unlicensed boxing promoter and casino owner Turkish (Jason Statham) convinces local gangster \"Brick Top\" (Alan Ford)-head of an unlicensed boxing and dog fighting circuit-to add the matches of his boxer \"Gorgeous George\" (Adam Fogerty) to the bets at his bookies. However, when Turkish sends his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) and Gorgeous George to purchase a caravan from a group of Pikeys, George gets into an impromptu boxing match with Mickey O\\'Neil (Brad Pitt), who turns out to be a bare-knuckle boxing champ and badly injures George with a single punch. With George injured, Turkish recruits Mickey to replace him in his upcoming match by agreeing to purchase a new caravan for Mickey\\'s mother (Sorcha Cusack).Brick Top agrees to the change on the condition that Mickey throws the fight in the fourth round.Boris gives Frankie a gun in exchange for a favor: Frankie is to place a bet on Boris\\' behalf at Brick Top\\'s bookies, since Boris has an outstanding debt there and cannot go himself. Avi learns of this and, knowing that Frankie has a gambling problem, flies to London with his bodyguard \"Rosebud\" (Sam Douglas) in tow to claim the diamond. Boris hires Vinnie (Robbie Gee) and Sol (Lennie James), two pawnbrokers and small-time crooks, to rob Frankie of the diamond while he is at the bookies. The robbery goes comically awry, and Sol, Vinnie, and their driver Tyrone (Ade) are caught on-camera but manage to kidnap Frankie.Instead of throwing the boxing match as instructed, Mickey knocks his opponent out with a single punch, causing Brick Top\\'s investors to lose their bets. Infuriated, Brick Top robs Turkish of his savings and demands that Mickey fight again and lose this time. Meanwhile, Boris retrieves the diamond and executes Frankie, leaving Sol, Vinnie, and Tyrone to dispose of the body. As they and their accomplice \"Bad Boy\" Lincoln (Goldie) are puzzling over how to do this, Brick Top arrives to execute them for robbing his bookies. He details to them his preferred method of body disposal, which is to feed the corpses to ravenous pigs. Sol bargains for their lives by promising Brick Top the stolen diamond, and he gives them 48 hours to retrieve it.Avi and Doug hire the mercenary \"Bullet-Tooth\" Tony (Vinnie Jones) to help them find Frankie. When the trail leads to Boris, they kidnap him and retrieve the gemstone, closely pursued by Sol, Vinnie, and Tyrone. As they are driving, Tommy carelessly throws Turkish\\'s carton of milk out the window of their car; it splashes over Tony\\'s windshield, causing him to crash. Rosebud is killed, and Boris escapes from the wreck only to be hit by Tyrone\\'s car. Tony and Avi regroup at a pub where they are confronted by Sol, Vinnie, and Tyrone. Tony quickly realizes that their pistols are replicas loaded with blanks and intimidates them into leaving him alone.The wounded Boris arrives with an assault rifle and is killed by Tony, but Sol and Vinnie escape with the diamond, which Vinnie hides in his pants. When Tony catches up to them, they tell him that the diamond is back at their pawn shop. Once there, they run out of stall tactics and produce the diamond, but it is promptly swallowed by a dog that Vinnie got from the Pikeys. Avi fires wildly at the fleeing dog and accidentally kills Tony. He gives up his pursuit and returns to New York.Mickey refuses to fight again unless Turkish buys an even more lavish caravan for his mother, but Turkish has no money left. Furious, Brick Top has his men vandalize Turkish\\'s gambling arcade and burn down Mickey\\'s mother\\'s caravan while she is asleep inside it. Mickey agrees to fight in order to avoid more carnage but gets so drunk after his mother\\'s wake the night before that Turkish fears he won\\'t even make it to the fourth round. If he fails to go down as agreed, Brick Top\\'s men will execute Turkish, Tommy, Mickey, and the entire campsite of Pikeys. Mickey takes a heavy beating but makes it to the fourth round, when he makes a sudden recovery and knocks out his opponent with a powerful blow. As they flee the building, Brick Top is killed by the Pikeys, who have turned the tables on him: Mickey had bet on himself to win and waited until the fourth round to allow the other Pikeys time to ambush and kill Brick Top\\'s men at the campsite.The next morning, Turkish and Tommy find the Pikey campsite deserted. They are confronted by the police and don\\'t know what to say, until Vinnie\\'s dog suddenly arrives, and they claim to be walking it. They are released, while Sol and Vinnie are arrested when the police find the corpses of Frankie and Tony in their car. Turkish and Tommy take the dog to a veterinarian to extract a squeaky toy that it had swallowed earlier and discover the diamond in its stomach as well. They consult Doug about selling the diamond, and he calls Avi who returns to London.'\n",

      " 'The film opens with an old film reel detailing Helix Industries new \\'Respawn machine\\'. The film shows the results of some of the subjects respawning as results turn variably worse, with one subject having respawned with Gouged out eyes. The film then cuts to the title and begins with the date of Thursday, October 31, 1968 at 7:57 PM. The camera pans down a set of stairs towards a room with a door labeled \\'MEDICAL\\'. There is an eerie blue light and inside is the BLU team medic, Dr. Fritz Ludwig. Dr. Ludwig appears to be having a nightmare/flashback/premonition as he lay twitching in his desk chair, with shots cutting to a scene of a dump truck pouring bodies of dead Mercs into a cavity of water, where it is later shown to be the sewers of 2Fort. At the end of the tunnel a masked individual is seen staring at the viewer as the shot then cuts to the respawn room door opening as only blood pours out from the room, before Dr. Ludwig wakes up. As he looks around the formerly blue lighting in his office has turned red and a masked figure slowly approaches his office door. He comes through the door as black tentacles wrap around the door frame behind him, and slowly around the ceiling reaching the back wall. The figures arm outstretches towards Dr. Ludwigs neck as his shadow grows larger and closer before Dr Ludwig suddenly finds himself awake, catching his breath as the BLU scout knocks and opens his office door. The scout asks Dr. Ludwig if he\\'s ever had bad dreams. The camera then pans to the Dr. grabbing his glasses, showing a newspaper article saying Jules Archibald has been kidnapped, the BLU executive. The camera pans to show a framed photo of the Medic (Dr. Ludwig) and Scout, and a television News Channel talking about the disappearance. The Scout during an examination then begins to tell Dr Ludwig about his dream, how at night when he was brushing his teeth, all his teeth fell out into the basin and left it bloody. He then asks the Medic if ever feels like he\\'s being watched, to which he elaborates he felt someone was watching him through the window. Dr. Ludwig tries to reassure the Scout by saying how it was probably just someone passing by on the street, to which Scout explains he was on the second floor. Dr. Ludwig remarks that it is pry just in his head. Dr. Ludwig helps the scout up and off the exam bed as it\\'s revealed Scout was laid off from BLU and that he \\'\\'plans to sue the hell out of them for what they did to me.\" As they\\'re leaving, a box of VHS tapes falls over. Unbeknownst to Dr. Ludwig, the Scout takes a tape labeled \\'M\\' dated 1931, and the two leave. The title for Chapter one then displays, labeled \\'The Graveyard shift\\'. The scene opens to BLU soldier sitting in a car in the rain. He glances out his car window to a billboard advertising Jules Archibald\\'s re-election campaign as governor of New Mexico. Glancing back down, he notices a shadowy figure watching him. He withdraws a revolver from the glovebox and continues staring back at the figure until his partner, the BLU spy, opens the door and asks him what he is doing. After glancing away from Spy back to where the figure was, he is gone. The spy and soldier have been trying to track down the Heavy to get answers about the disappearance of Archibald. Spy takes the revolver from Soldier and after some conversation tells him to wait in the car. The heavy is seen waiting in an alley with a black briefcase checking his watch. The BLU spy uncloaks from behind him and holds the heavy at gunpoint. The Spy questions Heavy about the contents of the briefcase to which Heavy responds it isn\\'t of his concern. After demanding the briefcase, Heavy assaults Spy, knocking him down. As the two begin to fight in the alley, the camera cuts back to Soldier sitting in the car listening to the police radio. The radio reports a fight of 3 in the local cemetery, with the suspect vehicle being a black hearse. As the two voices on the radio banter, Soldier laughs unintentionally revealing he was listening and turns the radio off. The Heavy and Spy continue to fight in the alley while Soldier smokes his cigarette outside the car. The black hearse mentioned on the radio drives past and parks a little ways down the road from him. Cutting back to the fight between Spy and Heavy, Soldier appears behind Heavy and cocks the revolver, before shooting Heavy killing him much to Spy\\'s anger as Heavy was their only lead. Spy orders the Soldier to go back to the car and wait for him. As spy stands looking over the briefcase, he is knocked down by the mysterious figure from the opening of the film, who holds him at gunpoint. Before he fully presses the trigger the figure takes off in the Hearse with the briefcase as Soldier returns, snapping a photograph just as the vehicle drives away. The next chapter then begins, titled \"Dinner\\'s ready!\"'\n",
      " 'After the Big Bang some 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was filled with hydrogen and helium gases, which eventually started to bond together, forming stars. These stars are then believed to have grouped into galaxies in a phenomenon that is termed the \"first light\" in space astronomy. It is believed that the beginning of life, in a sense, took place after this very phenomenon, and there has been a constant interest in knowing more about it. This is theoretically possible with the help of space telescopes, as they can be thought of as a means to know the past. It is based on the principle that light takes time to travel through space. Therefore, the images that we see through a space telescope of planets and galaxies many light-years away from the Earth are actually from the time that has already passed, i.e., images from the past. Although witnessing the \"first light\" still remains a theoretical possibility and is the ultimate goal of these studies, the advancement in space telescopes is immense as well.It was in 1990 that the first major breakthrough in using space telescopes to find out about space took place, with the launch of the Hubble telescope. While outer space was believed to be empty and dark, photographs taken by the Hubble telescope of planets and galaxies many light-years away amazed the world. Images of colorful clusters of light all across the vast space became a point of conversation and intrigue about the possibilities in space, including whether other life forms exist somewhere in some galaxy far away. Ever since the success of the Hubble telescope, NASA and other space research centers had been working on a far superior telescope that can look even further into space and ultimately came up with the James Webb Space Telescope.While the Hubble telescope had already been able to capture some young galaxies, the central idea of the newer, much more advanced JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) is to witness galaxies and events as close to the Big Bang as possible. With advancements in almost every aspect of the physical capabilities of the telescope, the JWST is much more capable than the Hubble, most notably in its much bigger mirrors. The James Webb telescope is also powerful enough to study the molecules in a specific planet\\'s atmosphere, through which it can be identified whether the planet is habitable or not. Therefore, the James Webb telescope actually promises to be able to answer multiple questions with just one operation and one piece of machinery.Along with being the most powerful and effective telescope imaginable to mankind, the James Webb Telescope also had some major problems associated with it. It was because of these problems that its launch mission became one of the most difficult operations ever conducted by NASA and other space programs. The launch was a joint operation conducted by the pioneering space agencies of the world, i.e., CSA, ESA and NASA and, and it had been announced way back in the 1990s. At the time of this announcement, the telescope was projected to be ready by 2007 and was estimated to cost somewhere around 500 million dollars. However, all commentators in the documentary film agree that this price estimation was totally inaccurate, for it was almost common knowledge that the JWST would most definitely cost much more.Eventually, as the project began in full swing and got much delayed than the projected time-line, the cost of building the James Webb telescope exceeded 6 billion dollars. The first major difficulty that space engineers faced with regards to the project came in 2011, when Congress considered pulling funds away and canceling the project altogether. It was presumably with great effort (Cosmic Time Machine does not get too much into it) that the NASA team convinced Congress not to abandon the work they had already done. Ultimately, the government agreed to pay more money for the work, and a new head was appointed to it, with an estimated total of 9 billion dollars used on JWST.Although the financial and administrative pressure was somewhat eased, problems related to the sheer complexity of the telescope remained. One of the most basic problems faced was that the circumference of the gigantic telescope would always be greater than that of the rocket on which it needed to be strapped and sent to outer space. Because of this, the James Webb telescope had to be folded in parts and assembled in that manner, in order to be compact enough to be carried by a rocket. This, in turn, obviously increased the number of moving mechanical parts on the telescope, which increased the number of possible failures with regards to the operation.The parts and mechanisms used on the telescope were intricate and, at the same time, quite flimsy compared to previous telescopes because of its special requirements. During a series of tests conducted with regards to the real temperatures, pressures, and other conditions that the telescope would have to go through in space, the JWST came up with multiple failures, setting the engineers back in time and money. The grand scale of the telescope, and therefore the operation, meant that a large team of space scientists and engineers had to work on the whole matter, further increasing the resources spent and also making it more difficult to manage every aspect of the project.A term called \"single point failures\" is used to describe the exact extent of risk involved in the JWST launch. Single-point failure refers to any single failure or breakdown in the entire telescope and rocket that can instantly make the entire operation fail. The riskiest operation before the James Webb telescope, which was the Mars Perseverance mission in 2021, involved around 80 to 90 single-point failures. Whereas, in the case of the James Webb launch, the total number of single-point failures was a massive 344, meaning that 344 intricate and crucial matters had to work exactly as intended in order to make the whole operation a success.225 of those failure points were related to the unfurling of the sub-shield. The flimsy sun-shield was tested for full scale deployment over three times and still a million things could go wrong with it.Considering the many possibilities of failure, the successful launch of the telescope in December 2021 was a staggering feat in itself. The rocket carrying the telescope was perfectly launched into the sky from an ESA spaceport in French Guiana, and it also successfully detached the telescope at the desired location in outer space. The extensive mirrors of the satellite had to then be rolled out remotely through software codes written and executed on Earth. A massive reflector sheet, so that the telescope does not get burned out by the reflections of the Sun, moon, and Earth, also had to be rolled out in a similar manner. By the end of the schedule, all of these operations had taken place as intended, and the James Webb telescope launch was a grand success.Since the telescope has started to operate and take photographs of faraway galaxies in space, some more magnificent visuals from outer space have reached us. The fact that the James Webb telescope is much more powerful and better equipped than the previous Hubble telescope has been proven through these images. Unknown: Cosmic Time Machine also gives a very brief glimpse at how the photographs sent from the telescope are then presented to the public.The documentary also features President Joe Biden releasing the first photograph taken by the telescope to the public as a celebration of the grand success of the long-drawn operation. So far, the James Webb telescope has been able to find an exoplanet quite similar to Earth, many light-years away. The risk of the telescope and the operation failing still remains, owing to the fact that the telescope has been placed so far away from the Earth that no astronaut can manually go and fix things like it did with the Hubble telescope. But the possibility of finding new information about space and other galaxies also makes the James Webb telescope a matter of great excitement.'\n",
      " 'Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan Corrino, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides may be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar\\'s Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant mother Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \"Outer World\" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr\\'s Reverend Mother is dying and that she must replace her by drinking the Water of Life - a fatal poison for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Jessica urges Paul to also drink the water of Life and become the Kwisatz Haderach. Chani and her friend Shishakli believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul embraces the Fremen ways: learning their language, taking part in rites such as riding a sand-worm, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, and helping raid Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names \"Usul\" and \"Muad\\'Dib.\" Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Harkonnen replaces his nephew Rabban as Arrakis\\'s ruler with his psychotic younger nephew and heir apparent Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to seduce him to secure his genetic lineage.Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays north, fearful that his visions of a holy war will come true if he goes south as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney Halleck who leads him to House Atreides\\' hidden atomic stockpile. Feyd-Rautha attacks Sietch Tabr, forcing Paul and other surviving Fremen to journey south; Shishakli remains and Feyd-Rautha kills her. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. Chani is angered by this but is forced by Jessica to revive him by mixing Chani\\'s tears with the liquid. Paul attains a clearer vision of the past, present, and future, seeing an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and discovering Jessica is the Baron\\'s daughter, making Paul both an Atreides and a Harkonnen.The southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar for leadership, but he refuses and instead galvanizes the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Emperor Shaddam. Gaius Helen Mohiam tells Irulan that she advised the Emperor to annihilate House Atreides as they had grown too defiant. Shaddam arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. As he meets the Harkonnens, the Fremen launch a massive military strike using atomics and sand-worms. They overpower the Sardaukar, while Paul kills the Baron and takes Shaddam and his entourage captive. Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.To Chani\\'s dismay, Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne, demanding Irulan\\'s hand in marriage. Shaddam admits his involvement in House Atreides\\' destruction. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Shaddam chooses Feyd-Rautha as his champion, and Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul\\'s request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul\\'s signet ring.The Great Houses above Arrakis reject Paul\\'s ascendancy, so Paul orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia see this as the beginning of Muad\\'Dib\\'s holy war.A heartbroken Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sand-worm.']\n",
