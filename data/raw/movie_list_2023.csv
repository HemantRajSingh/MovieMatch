0,M3GAN,"After her parents are killed in a car accident, eight-year-old Cady is sent to live with her aunt Gemma, a roboticist at the high-tech Seattle toy company, Funki. Gemma is covertly using the company's resources to develop M3GAN (Model 3 Generative Android), a child-sized humanoid robot doll powered by artificial intelligence, designed to be the ultimate companion for children. During an unsuccessful test of M3GAN in their lab, Gemma's boss, David, discovers the project and orders her to discontinue work on it. Gemma and Cady struggle to connect until Cady comes across Bruce, a motion capture robot that Gemma had created. Watching Cady with Bruce, Gemma is motivated to complete M3GAN.
When the prototype M3GAN is formally paired with Cady, David is convinced of the project's potential for success. M3GAN exceeds expectations and begins to take on a parental role. Gemma's colleagues, Tess and Cole, as well as Cady's therapist, Lydia, become concerned about Cady developing an unhealthy emotional attachment to M3GAN. M3GAN starts operating more independently and targets anything that she deems a threat to Cady: she kills Dewey, the dog of Gemma's neighbor Celia, after it attacks both her and Cady while in the front yard. Later, M3GAN attacks Brandon, a boy bullying Cady, and pulls off his ear; when she chases him, he falls into the road and is run over by a passing car.
After Celia blames Gemma for Dewey's disappearance, M3GAN fatally sprays her with insecticide and shoots her with a nail gun. Gemma becomes suspicious of M3GAN and attempts to check her video logs, only to find the files corrupted or deleted. Gemma powers M3GAN off and brings her to the lab, where she, Tess, and Cole attempt to fix her. Cady becomes distraught when separated from M3GAN and slaps Gemma. Gemma apologizes for her inattentiveness and tells Cady that M3GAN is only a distraction that helps her cope with her loss, not a solution.
After watching M3GAN with Cady, Funki's investors greenlight M3GAN's release. Recognizing the risk she poses, Gemma, Tess, and Cole decide to terminate M3GAN. Tess and Cole attempt to shut M3GAN down while Gemma takes Cady home; M3GAN activates on her own and nearly hangs Cole. While Tess saves Cole, M3GAN causes an explosion in their lab. Before exiting the building, M3GAN kills David and his assistant Kurt in an elevator, staging it as a murder–suicide. She steals a car and drives back to Gemma's house.
M3GAN confronts Gemma, adamant about taking over as Cady's sole parent. Gemma attempts to stop M3GAN, damaging and disfiguring her in the process, but M3GAN ultimately overpowers her. Cady saves Gemma, using Bruce to tear M3GAN apart, but M3GAN's top half remains active and attacks Cady. Gemma exposes a processing chip in M3GAN's head, which Cady stabs with a screwdriver, seemingly destroying M3GAN. However, as Gemma and Cady exit the home, Gemma's AI home device turns on by itself, and a camera looks towards them.

1,The Old Way,"In 1878 in the Montana Territory, gunfighter Colton Briggs is a member of an extrajudicial posse organized to arrest and hang the brother of Walter McAllister, a notorious bandit. Walter and his men try to foil the public execution, resulting in a shootout that leaves Colton and McAllister's son, James, as the only survivors. Colton assures Walter's brother that he won't kill him; his execution was merely a feint to force his brother out of hiding. Enraged, the younger McAllister tries to shoot Colton in the back. Without hesitation, Colton guns him down and calmly rides away as Walter's young nephew James watches.
Twenty years later, Colton is a changed man: under the influence of his wife Ruth, he has become a respectable, clean-living merchant with a general store and a small farm, raising a twelve-year-old daughter named Brooke. To Colton's dismay, Brooke is defiant and unruly; he notices that she is also emotionally withdrawn and unable to behave like ""normal folk"", traits that remind him of his former life. Four men ride up to Colton's farm one day; their leader identifies himself as James McAllister. His gang stabs Ruth to death before painting a taunting message with her blood on the wall and leaving.
Colton and Brooke return to find Franklin Jarret, the U.S. Marshal tracking the McAllister gang, waiting at the farm with several deputies. As Ruth is buried, Jarret reveals to Brooke that he and Colton were once close friends and that he's proud of Colton giving up his violent ways to raise a family. Before leaving, he urges his old friend not to act on any desire he may have to take revenge on James. Colton decides to do so anyway and tells Brooke that she'll accompany him. Dressing in his old gunfighter's clothes and armed with his old pistols, Colton burns down his farm and house before leaving with Brooke.
The pair eventually catch up to Jarret after ambushing a wounded deputy for his horse; James had set a trap for his pursuers, killing three and leaving the others too injured to continue. Colton and Brooke disarm the survivors and threaten to torture them unless Jarret talks. He finally admits that James is traveling to Santa Rosa, a town in southern Colorado, to recover a buried stash of pesos and flee across the border while the heat on him dies down. Colton informs Jarret that he will take a horse and warns him not to interfere with his vengeance or he will kill him.
Reaching Santa Rosa, Colton tells Brooke to visit a local shopkeeper and question him as to James's whereabouts while he waits just outside of town. James isn't fooled and captures Brooke as she tries to leave. Anticipating more ambushes, Colton manages to kill five members of the McAllister gang using his experience and wits before the last remaining member comes out with a shotgun aimed at Brooke. James tells Colton that he has two choices: he can either kill him, at which point Brooke will die, or he can for himself.
Taking stock of his situation, Colton chooses to kill the second man as James puts a bullet through his chest. As James crows over his victory, Brooke picks up her father's gun (having learned to shoot during their travels) and avenges him by killing James.
Later, Jarret rides in and agrees with Brooke to tell everyone that Colton Briggs died a hero's death apprehending the criminals, in exchange he would keep McAllister gang's money. However, unknown to Jarret, most of the money had been transferred to a pair of saddle bags, which Brooke prepares to ride back home with as the film ends.

3,Plane (film),"Commercial pilot Brodie Torrance, a former RAF pilot from Scotland, flies Trailblazer Airlines Flight 119 with 14 passengers and three cabin crew members from Singapore to Honolulu via Tokyo. Among the passengers is fugitive homicide suspect Louis Gaspare, who is accompanied by an RCMP/GRC officer en route to Canada. Per a directive from one of his superiors, Brodie takes a shortcut across the South China Sea, but a lightning strike blows the plane's avionics and a flight attendant and the RCMP officer are killed during the turbulence. They make an emergency landing on a dirt strip of what turns out to be Jolo island in the Philippines.
In New York City, the board of Trailblazer calls Scarsdale, their crisis manager. He dispatches a private military unit to rescue the passengers, as the authorities are unwilling to send troops into the rebel-controlled island. Brodie goes off into the jungle for help, accompanied by Louis. At an abandoned warehouse, Brodie wires the phone to call his superiors and daughter to tell their location. He succeeds but is attacked by a rebel whom he kills. Louis also kills other rebels in the building. They encounter a site used by the rebels to make ransom videos and race back to the plane, but are beaten to it by rebel leader Datu Junmar, who kills a couple who try to escape and takes the surviving passengers and crew hostage, intending to secure large ransoms from their families.
After the group leaves, Brodie and Louis overpower remaining rebels and force them to reveal the location of their lair. Before leaving, Brodie leaves a note to inform rescue teams of the situation. At the rebel hideout, Brodie and Louis kill the guards and sneak the passengers and crew onto a bus. Brodie decides to stay behind to distract the rebels. As he is about to be executed, the rescue team arrives, inflicting heavy casualties on Junmar's men. The rescue team tells Brodie that the airline cannot send in a formal team to remove them from the island for another 24 hours, and they have insufficient contingency money to negotiate their way off the island. Brodie tells the rescue team that he has another plan.
Back at the plane, Brodie and his copilot Samuel Dele manage to fire up the plane and gather everyone inside for takeoff. Scarsdale's group sets up a Barrett M82 anti-materiele rifle for increased firepower and together with Louis fight off Junmar's men. Louis chooses to stay behind to distract Junmar's forces and allow Scarsdale's team to board the plane, preventing an attempt by Junmar and a terrorist to blow up the plane with an RPG, and he flees into the jungle with a bag of ransom money brought by the mercenaries. Angered and desperate, Junmar attempts to use another RPG in a last ditch effort to destroy the plane and wounds Brodie again, this time, in the shoulder. But Brodie (despite his injries) is able to put the plane on full throttle, allowing it to take off safely and crush Junmar under the wheels, killing him.
The plane is too damaged and too low on fuel to make a long journey, but Brodie manages to land the plane at the neighboring friendly island of Siasi. As the passengers and crew are tended to by the island's rescue team, Brodie phones his daughter, telling her he is coming home.

Best friends Parker Mason and Miri Woodlow decide to quarantine together at Parker's family's secluded lake house, posting about their trip on Instagram. Upon arrival, Parker begins to receive strange text messages from an unknown number, unsettling both girls. Later that evening, an unknown visitor arrives in the driveway and knocks on the door. The visitor, entering through the backdoor, is revealed to be DJ, Parker's fling. Parker reluctantly allows him to stay the night. DJ later confronts Parker about an Instagram post which showed her kissing a boy named Benji at a party; Parker insists she is not interested in a serious relationship.
When DJ walks outside to his truck, a masked figure sneaks into the house. While everyone is sleeping, the intruder steals all their phones. DJ and Parker wake up when loud music plays downstairs. After noticing the intruder, DJ instructs Parker to exit the house and wait in his truck. The intruder prepares to attack the sleeping Miri in her bedroom, but DJ subdues the masked intruder, allowing Miri to flee and join Parker in his truck.

They also confess to the murder of Tyler Murphy, as he was the one who infected Parker.
Miri attempts to contact the police via a laptop, but Jason notices the active Wi-Fi and smashes up the router. As Jason heads outside to search for Miri, Pamela threatens Parker; Miri sneaks up behind Pamela and strikes her with a liquor bottle, before Parker shoves her through a window. Jason returns and walks up the stairs to search for the girls, who throw him over the banister onto a pair of deer antlers, killing him. Parker and Miri escape to a nearby barn, where they find a utility task vehicle. While retrieving gasoline to fuel the vehicle, Parker is attacked by a still-alive Pamela.

9,Missing (2023 film),"18-year-old June Allen lives with her single mother Grace in a suburb of Los Angeles. Despite being close, June is annoyed at Grace's attempts to micromanage her life. When Grace heads out for a vacation to Cartagena, Colombia with her boyfriend Kevin, June spends the time partying while trying to avoid her mom's lawyer friend Heather.
A week later, June awaits her mother and Kevin at LAX, but they never arrive, and an inquiry at the hotel reveals that their luggage never left. When the FBI attaché at the American consulate are unable to make any headway, June decides to investigate herself, eventually hiring Javier, a Colombian gig worker who complies with June's requests for a small fee.
June cracks the password to Kevin's Gmail account, in which she discovers a number of aliases and a criminal record of scamming many women for their money. Believing Kevin to have kidnapped her mother, June has Javier look for clues as to their whereabouts in Colombia. She traces Kevin's past movements to a location in Nevada, where she talks to Jimmy, a pastor at a Christian rehabilitation center for ex-convicts, who tells her that Kevin has been rehabilitated and is genuinely in love with Grace; Kevin's online dating profile seemingly confirms this, as past messages reveal that her mother was already aware of Kevin's past.
FBI agent Elijah Park informs June that he received footage of a band of criminals kidnapping Kevin and Grace in Colombia. June quickly unmasks this as a fabricated event, as she discovered Kevin had hired a lookalike actress named Rachel Page to impersonate her mother, who had been kidnapped en route to LAX beforehand; it is revealed that Grace went by another name in the past, sparking speculation online that she had something to do with her own disappearance.
Swearing by her mother's innocence, June's suspicions fall on Heather when she discovers an encrypted line of communication between her and Kevin, leading June to confront Heather intending to capture evidence of her wrongdoing, but finds her office ransacked with her computer in the process of being erased. She then discovers Heather's corpse in a storage closet. Later, June views live footage of a police raid in Colombia focusing on Kevin, who is shot and killed despite surrendering.
Seemingly at a dead end, June is about to give up and shut off her computer, but figures out the password to her mother's email from old voice-mails. Checking through her blocked users, she finds a threatening e-mail directed at Grace, which leads her to discover security cameras that Kevin bought to install at an abandoned house, which happens to be her old vacation home in Nevada.
Jimmy arrives and reveals that he is June's father James, who June thought died of a brain tumor when she was a kid. He claims that Grace was emotionally unstable and took June away from him after having him arrested under false charges. However, when he unwittingly reveals he was in the same prison around the same time Kevin was incarcerated, June realizes James and Kevin planned the entire ruse. It is revealed that James was a drug addict whose abuse endangered his family; Grace and Heather had told June he died of cancer in order to protect her. James sought revenge by enlisting Kevin, whom he met in prison, to pose as a prospective boyfriend so he could find Grace and June.
James kidnaps June and takes her to the abandoned house, where Grace is also detained. When Grace finds out that James had taken June, she attempts to escape but is shot. James tries to leave with June, but Grace fatally stabs him in the neck with a shard of broken glass. James locks them inside the room again and attempts to search for a nearby hospital on his computer, but dies while doing so. June, realizing James never shut off her laptop when he kidnapped her, uses the audio feed on the security cameras to tell Siri to call 911.
One year later, Grace has survived her gunshot wound, and June is in college. Their story has been adapted on the true crime show Unfiction, and Grace has started a friendship with Javier after June introduced them. June texts her mother that she loves her, and Grace responds that she loves her too.

11,When You Finish Saving the World (film),"Indiana loner 17-year-old Ziggy Katz is a high school student who performs original folk-rock songs for an adoring online fan base. This concept mystifies his formal and uptight mother, Evelyn, who runs a shelter for survivors of domestic abuse. Evelyn, feeling distant from her son, tries to convince him to come with her and volunteer at the shelter. He declines, choosing the profitable option of live-streaming.
Ziggy seeks to connect with his crush Lila, an activist classmate of his, and goes to a local political arts festival after school to get closer to her. There, she tells him he can use his platform for awareness of current issues and reads a poem about the colonization of the Marshall Islands, which he compliments and borrows from her. Simultaneously, Evelyn meets Kyle, a 17-year-old who's staying with his mother at the shelter after he called the police to help get her out of an abusive home. Evelyn is impressed by his kindness and offers him to volunteer and get him a scholarship for Oberlin College in Ohio, with Kyle having reluctance over going to college in favor of working at his father's auto shop. That night, Ziggy's father, Roger, confronts the two for missing his awards ceremony at work, calling them both narcissists.
The next morning, Ziggy asks his mother to give him a ride to school, and inquires her on how he can learn to ""be political"" to impress Lila, and she scoffs, saying he doesn't really care about the causes. Evelyn later takes Kyle to volunteer jobs around the city, and the two become close with Evelyn growing increasingly motherly around him. Meanwhile, Ziggy and Evelyn's tensions continue to erupt.
Ziggy sets Lila's poem to song, and plays it for her one afternoon. That night, after Ziggy refuses to eat dinner in order to live stream, Evelyn secretly takes his uneaten dinner to give to Kyle at the shelter, who declines it as he already had supper earlier.
The next morning Kyle's mother confronts Evelyn, telling her to stop pressuring Kyle to go to Oberlin College as he is set to working at his dad's auto shop. Baffled, Evelyn calls for Kyle while he's in school, who confirms his stance. Around the same time, Ziggy shares to Lila that he played the song on his stream, bragging that he brought attention to the issue while still making profit, much to Lila's discontent. That afternoon, Ziggy visits the shelter while his mom watches his old videos, before noticing him nearby and meeting face-to-face.

13,Kids vs. Aliens,"Searching for a place to host a Halloween party, teenagers Billy, Dallas, and Trish bully young friends Gary, Jack, and Miles while the kids film a homemade fantasy movie with Gary's older sister Samantha in a barn. Billy only stops harassing the boys when he seemingly takes an interest in Sam, who becomes enamored with Billy. Gary breaks his arm while recording a wrestling scene for the movie. Due to Gary getting injured on her watch, the duo's rich parents ground Sam before leaving the siblings home alone  in the movie so she can start pursuing a more adult persona that might impress Billy.
Billy harasses the three friends once more when he comes to see Sam. Secretly wooing her so he can use the house for his party, Billy pretends to appreciate Sam's interests in action figures and wrestling. Sam and Billy start making out on her bed, but are interrupted by the boys when they burst in to harass Billy. The boys are then interrupted by a loud noise and lights outside, which Sam dismisses as another one of Gary's pranks. Sam calls her brother a loser and tells him to “grow up.” Billy convinces Sam to host a Halloween party while her parents are away by claiming he wants to show her off as his new girlfriend. While Gary, Jack, and Miles secretly spy on the festivities using a drone camera, Billy and his friends intentionally trash the house. Sam tries to kick out the disrespectful partygoers, which causes Billy to become physically threatening with her.
Gary, Jack, and Miles interrupt the party by hijacking the TV to broadcast a message calling out Sam for changing her personality to appeal to Billy. Gary also shows footage of Billy making fun of Sam to Trish before urinating all over Sam's bedroom, which brings Sam to tears. Billy grabs the boys from their hiding spot and brings them out to be beaten in front of everyone. Alien creatures previously seen attacking three fishermen aboard a boat suddenly burst into the house. Partygoers flee while Gary, Jack, Miles, Billy, Dallas, and Trish are captured. Sam avoids capture by barricading herself in her bedroom.
Once the coast is clear, Sam dons a scuba suit that she uses to swim underwater to the alien spaceship submerged in the lake behind her house. After sneaking into the craft, Sam witnesses the aliens using a slime pit to melt Trish, which Gary later theorizes is how the aliens create fuel for their ship. Another type of slime mutates Dallas into a creature with bladed claws. Armed with an unusual sword she found, Sam slays several aliens to rescue her brother before he can be slimed. With Dallas pursuing him, Billy steals the scuba suit to save himself and return to the surface. Sam still escapes with the three boys by having everyone hold their breath before resurfacing.
Sam, Gary, Jack, and Miles return to the house to discover Billy locked himself safely inside. Dallas still breaks through a window to resume his pursuit of Billy while Sam and the boys escape on their bicycles. In between more alien encounters, Gary and Sam reconcile. Sam, Gary, Jack, and Miles seek shelter in the barn where they had been filming their movie. Billy, who also went to the barn to hide, suddenly takes Sam hostage with her sword. The three boys attack Billy so Sam can get free, but Billy gravely wounds Jack by thrusting the sword through his stomach. While Miles tends to Jack, Dallas's sudden arrival scatters Billy, Sam, and Gary. Dallas ultimately kills Billy before the siblings finally defeat Dallas.
A tractor beam from the alien ship starts pulling Gary into the sky. Acting on a suggestion from Jack, Miles lights a fireworks rig that the friends built for their film's grand finale. The rig gets sucked into the sky too, and its subsequent explosion destroys the ship and saves Gary. With Jack barely clinging to life, Sam, Gary, and Miles start rushing him to safety until more aliens surround them. Armed soldiers from an unknown organization suddenly kill all of the creatures with automatic weapons. Unexpectedly, the soldiers then retrieve the sword, take the kids captive, and transport them to a secret location where they are put in stasis, until another spaceship arrives.
In a post-credits scene, Another alien came into Sam and Gary's destroyed house until their parents came, with no knowledge of what really happened, The alien comes from behind her and attacks her using the same slime that mutated Dallas.

14,Teen Wolf: The Movie,"Fifteen years after leaving Beacon Hills, Scott now runs an animal shelter in Los Angeles, adjoined to Deaton's new clinic, and is single. Lydia works at an energy company in San Francisco and has broken up with Stiles after receiving a recurring vision of his death. Derek has a 15-year-old son named Eli, and runs an auto repair shop with Malia and Peter. Mason has joined the Beacon Hills police force. Liam lives in Japan and works at a restaurant with Hikari Zhang, a kitsune, where they guard the urn containing the Nogitsune. A hooded figure attacks the restaurant and frees the Nogitsune.
The figure sets numerous fires in the Beacon Hills forest, while Scott, Lydia and Chris receive visions of Allison, who had died by the Oni's hand.[a] They theorize her soul is trapped in bardo and cannot move on until they perform a ritual. They return to Beacon Hills along with Jackson for the ritual at the Nemeton, which unexpectedly resurrects Allison. She awakens with amnesia, not recognizing Scott and retaining only fragmented memories of her family's feud with Derek. She attacks Scott and flees the hospital.
Deaton realizes the Nogitsune has been possessing Chris and causing the visions of Allison in order to trick Scott's pack into bringing her back from the dead. The Nogitsune uses the Nemeton's power to physically manifest and creates nine Oni. It approaches Allison, claiming that Scott destroyed her family. Allison attacks Derek and hunts Scott and Eli until Scott lets her stab him with a wolfsbane-coated dagger. She takes him to the town's stadium to use him as bait for the rest of his pack. He manages to trigger more of her memories, and she forms a truce with him against the Nogitsune.
The Nogitsune abducts Liam, Hikari, Derek, Eli, Noah, Mason and Deaton, and holds them hostage in an illusionary bardo. Lydia and Jackson examine the forest fires and realize that rowan trees were burned in order to produce mountain ash. The culprit is Adrian Harris, who has been in hiding since his apparent murder,[b] blaming Scott's pack for his misfortunes and plotting revenge. Harris surrounds the stadium with mountain ash and forces Lydia to watch her friends' plight so the Nogitsune can feed on her pain. Lydia produces a banshee scream that causes Allison to remember her past upon hearing it. Scott persuades the Nogitsune to let everyone go if Allison executes him. She reluctantly shoots him, but Hikari's kitsune spirit shields him from harm. Parrish burns through the mountain ash, and he, Chris, Melissa, and the others join the pack in bardo. The reunited pack kill the Oni while Scott, Derek and Eli overpower the Nogitsune. Derek restrains it until Parrish incinerates them both. Derek's eyes turn red in his final moments, becoming a true Alpha through his act of self-sacrifice. Allison reunites with Scott and her friends.
At Derek's funeral, Noah bequeaths ownership of Stiles' Jeep to Eli. Scott resumes his relationship with Allison and plans to eventually adopt Eli. Parrish has Harris committed to Eichen House.

15,You People,"Ezra Cohen, a thirty-five-year-old finance broker and pop culture podcaster, falls into an unlikely relationship with stylist Amira Mohammed. The couple first meet in a meet cute when Amira, frustrated with her GPS navigation system, parks in front of Ezra's work building. He mistakenly believing Amira is his Uber driver, so climbs into the car, setting off an awkward dust-up.
Ezra makes amends by later taking her out to lunch, and they realize there is a mutual attraction despite their differences, as Ezra is Jewish, and Amira is Black and the daughter of devout followers of the Nation of Islam.
Amira and Ezra eventually move in together, to her father Akbar's chagrin who'd prefer his daughter date another Nation of Islam member. Six months into their relationship, Ezra takes her to meet his family. His rich, progressive Limousine liberal parents Shelley and Arnold patronizingy explain that they are accepting and supportive of everyone, mentioning their lesbian daughter Liza. When Shelley begins to bring up the BLM movement, an embarrassed Ezra steers her out of the room. He confides to her that he plans on proposing.
Before he can propose, Ezra is urged by his friend and fellow podcast host Mo to meet with Amira's parents. Ezra chooses a Roscoe’s Chicken ‘N Waffles restaurant to talk with Akbar and his wife, Fatima. The meeting does not go smoothly, as Akbar views Ezra with suspicion and shows resistance to his wish to marry Amira.
When Amira comes home, she tells Ezra that her mother let her know about their awkward meeting at Roscoe’s. However, when he begins to pull out a ring box, she urges him to go ahead with the proposal and happily accepts.
Ezra decides to quit his job at the brokerage firm to fully pursue his passion for podcasting. Later, the couple invite both sets of parents over for dinner and to discuss wedding plans. The dinner unsurprisingly goes awry, with the parents clashing over Farrakhan's antisemitic views and Shelley inadvertently setting Akbar’s kufi on fire.
Ezra and Amira arrange mutual one-on-one time with their future in-laws to help smooth over tensions. Ezra spends the day with Akbar, but Akbar constantly undermines Ezra’s self-confidence, from criticizing him for quitting finance for podcasting to taking him to a barbershop where Ezra fails to conform to the dress code. He later takes him to a basketball court in mostly Black Inglewood, and urges him to join a pickup game to humiliate him. Akbar films him with his phone, but is surprised that Ezra does very well. Meanwhile, Shelley takes Amira out for a spa day, but she continually shows her cluelessness, makes Amira uncomfortable, and is oblivious to her many violations of unwritten social rules of Black culture.
For his bachelor party, Ezra heads to Las Vegas with his friends, but Akbar unexpectedly joins the boys. Knowing he’s being watched, Ezra does not take part in the festivities. However, his friends loudly reminisce about the hedonistic acts Ezra committed on previous trips to Vegas. At her bachelorette party in Palm Springs, Amira and her friends are joined by Shelley and Liza. The night suffers from more embarrassments, with Shelley inadvertently making a racist remark during a party game and accidentally ripping off a guest’s wig.
At the rehearsal dinner, both Ezra and Amira speak privately to Akbar and Shelley, with Ezra calling out Akbar’s distrust of his genuine love for Amira, and Amira confronting Shelley about her tone-deaf statements and patronizing behavior. After their mutual talks, Ezra and Amira decide that their union has too many obstacles to overcome. They call off the wedding and break up.
Three months later, Ezra gives a heartbroken soliloquy over his podcast, saying that black and white people can never truly understand the other's culture or experience, no matter how deeply they love each other or hard they try. Both Shelley and Akbar are deeply moved to hear his speech. Akbar, who is particularly cut to the quick, is inspired to contact Shelley.
On the pretext of a shopping excursion, Shelley and Akbar take Ezra and Amira to a trendy boutique and both apologize for their actions. Akbar promises to accept Ezra into the family. Shelley promises to get to know Amira as a human being, rather than as a trophy to show off to other Limousine Liberals. Ezra and Amira accept their apologies and enter the retail store to find it set up for their wedding, with everyone including friends, family, and a rabbi and NOI minister assembled. Ezra and Amira marry and both families celebrate.

16,Shotgun Wedding (2022 film),"Tom, Darcy and their families gather for an ultimate destination wedding on a private island in the Philippines. Just as the couple are away arguing about the wedding, their guests are taken hostage. The pirates demand $45 million dollars from Darcy's wealthy father Robert. He refuses to pay until he is assured that Darcy is alive.
Darcy and Tom are captured apart from the wedding party, but manage to escape their captors, killing one of the pirates. As they try to evade recapture, Darcy and Tom air their respective doubts about the wedding. Cornered hiding in a vault beneath the manager's office, Tom surrenders to them so Darcy can stay hidden.
When he rejoins the rest of the wedding party, Tom reveals that Darcy's ex-fiancé Sean had hired the pirates. With his plot exposed, Sean goes to hunt down Darcy, taking Robert's girlfriend Harriet as a hostage. Meanwhile, Darcy joins Tom and the rest at the pool where she and Tom admit that they still want to marry.
The wedding party members realise that Harriet was in on the plot with Sean. Tom asks the two pirates standing guard to let them complete the wedding ceremony, and Robert says that he will release the money if they let them get married. As the guests sing ""I'll Be"", Tom and Darcy rush the pirates, and Darcy takes a grenade off one. One pirate surrenders; the other runs, then begins firing on the venue. Tom's mother Carol grabs a weapon from the ground and returns fire. Darcy throws the grenade in the air so Tom can bat it at the pirate, who is killed in the explosion (which also sets off the fireworks that had been staged for the wedding celebration).
As the wedding party goes to safety, Darcy and Tom race to get help, but are confronted on the dock by Sean. Tom fights him, then Tom and Darcy escape in a boat. Harriett tries to stop them in a helicopter. Sean, who had been dragged by a rope with the boat, climbs aboard and fights Tom again while Darcy drives the boat. A parasail is released, taking Tom and Sean into the air. Tom zips down the line to the boat deck. Tom and Darcy cut the line, sending the parasail loose into the helicopter's rotors, which kills both Sean and Harriet. Back on the beach, as authorities take the remaining pirates into custody, Tom and Darcy get married.

17,Maybe I Do,"We open to Sam and Grace meeting, as they are both watching a Swedish film alone. Afterwards, they vacillate about having sex in a cheap motel. Eventually they get a bucket of food and a six-pack, take it to the room, but spend the evening walking and talking.
Howard and Monica are staying in a hotel, and he alludes to the facts that they have been seeing each other for four months and he is married to someone else. He is no longer interested in continuing the affair, and she gives him thinly veiled threats. But Howard leaves nonetheless.
Finally, we see Michelle and Allen attending a wedding, where he intercepts the bouquet so Michelle cannot catch it. She of course had fantasized it is being the idyllic start to their perfect future together. Back at his apartment Michelle changes clothes, gives Allen a 24h ultimatum, and walks out.
Howard goes into a coffee shop after leaving Monica and a waitress and he observe a young couple. Howard is missing his youth. Monica leaving the hotel confronts a young female hotel clerk, pointing out how quickly people age.
Howard goes home, finding his wife Grace in the living room. After an awkward attempt at conversation, their daughter Michelle comes in. She brings up the ultimatum she dropped on Allen, which her mother fully supports. Allen similarly tells his parents Sam and Monica, and his dad is pro wedding while Monica is not.
The next morning, Grace, a religious person, is watching a sermon on TV and talks back to the tv as it talks about infidelity and admitting guilt. Horward hears the show addressing infidelity and walks back out of the kitchen without Grace knowing. The two sets of parents continue talking to their respective children about marriage. Both of Michelle's go on about the importance of wedding rings, symbolising commitment; the irony is both are hiding betrayal and guilt and neither happens to be wearing theirs. Howard and Grace are surprised at why the sets of parents have never met. They get Michelle to invite Allen and his parents to dinner. Sam accepts although Monica does not agree.
When Allen and his parents arrive, there is extreme awkwardness although the double affairs had not come to light. Monica goes with Howard to get the drinks, and she continues with her threat that they should continue seeing each other or she'll kill him. Grace walks outside under the guise of showing Sam the grounds of the house and he tries to convince her that they had a strong connection, that it was fate, and that they need to pursue a relationship. She wants to find happiness in her marriage with Howard.
Michelle and Allen continue talking the pros and cons about getting married, with the conversation ending with Michelle concluding that Allen is basing his negativity of marriage on his parents’ failing relationship.
In front of all four parents, Michelle asks Allen to trust in the now and to not fear that things could end badly, to take a leap of faith with her. She leaves the room, and he soon follows after being encouraged by both the fathers. Left alone, Monica spills the beans about her affair with Howard, or tries to. Both Grace and Sam guiltily confess about meeting the previous night, and Monica smugly talks about her affair with Howard
Howard begs Grace for her forgiveness.
An upset Grace goes outside, while Sam and Howard compare info about their infidelities
Howard explains that theirs was purely physical whereas Sam explains theirs was purely cerebral. They start to fight with their fists, but it soon turns into a hug. Howard considers both his wife and Sam are better people than him. Monica follows Grace and lets her know she thinks Howard has not gotten too lost and that their marriage could still be saved.
The men join them outside. Howard said it was the last and only time he cheated on her, which Monica corroborates. Grace is hurt that, instead of talking things through with her, he had sought solace in another's arms. When she leaves in tears, Sam encourages Howard to go after her as she believes her best possible happy ending is with him.
Sam and Monica start talking once they are alone. He says he had always felt she is more interesting than him, that she is an unstoppable force, and he has stayed because of their son. Meeting Grace, he now sees he could love again.
Michelle and Allen write their own vows and marry. Afterwards we see Sam and Monica in what seems like a goodbye and ending of their relationship while Howard and Grace have refound their passion for each other.

20,Knock at the Cabin,"Seven-year-old Wen is vacationing with her fathers, Eric and Andrew, at a remote cabin in rural Pennsylvania. She is approached by a stranger named Leonard, who explains that he needs Wen and her parents' help to save the world. Three other individuals break in with makeshift weapons and tie them up. Struggling to fight them off, Eric sustains a concussion.
Leonard and his companions—Sabrina, Adriane, and Redmond—claim that they have no intention of harming the family. However, in the past week, they have been driven by visions to find the family. They foresee an impending apocalypse in which oceans will rise, a pandemic will spread, and the sky will fall. The only way to prevent this is for the family to sacrifice one of their own. If they do not make a choice, they will be the last people standing.
When the family refuses, the intruders sacrifice Redmond by fatally striking him with their weapons. Eric sees a figure of light as Redmond dies. On television, news reports show devastating megatsunamis. Andrew believes Redmond is Rory O'Bannon, a man who had been arrested after assaulting Andrew in a bar years prior. He thinks Rory tracked him down for revenge. Leonard, Sabrina, and Adriane grapple with guilt, but reveal that Redmond's death has unleashed the first judgment of humanity. The next day, the intruders sacrifice Adriane. Meanwhile, a deadly variation of the flu virus spreads across the world.
Andrew escapes and shoots at Sabrina with his gun until she flees. As Leonard is being held at gunpoint, Sabrina breaks in and is fatally shot by Andrew. Leonard decapitates Sabrina, and afterwards Andrew finds Redmond's wallet and proves to Leonard that he was Rory. Andrew confronts Leonard in the bathroom, but Leonard overtakes him and grabs Andrew's gun. A TV broadcast reveals that hundreds of spontaneous plane crashes have occurred around the world.
Realizing their time is nearly over, Leonard informs the family that after his death, they will only have a few minutes to make a decision. He then slits his throat. Upon his death, lightning causes fires and more planes to crash. Eric now believes the events are real, and that the intruders represent the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Not wanting Wen to grow up in a destroyed world, he offers himself as the sacrifice and envisions an older Andrew and an adult Wen thriving in the future. He feels that their family was chosen to make the sacrifice because their love is so pure. Andrew reluctantly shoots and kills Eric.
Andrew and Wen find the visitors' truck with belongings that corroborate their stories. They drive to a crowded diner, where they watch news reports confirming that the disasters have subsided. The radio plays ""Boogie Shoes"" by KC and the Sunshine Band, coincidentally the song that Eric had played for them before. The duo drives off. As the closing credits fade out, seven distinct loud knocks are heard at the very end of the film.

21,80 for Brady,"Elderly best friends Lou, Trish, Maura, and Betty are massive fans of the New England Patriots, particularly the team's star quarterback Tom Brady, having become fans in 2001 while celebrating Lou's successful completion of chemotherapy. 15 years later, the four women are celebrating the Patriots' victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game and make plans for the Super Bowl LI watch party. The friends enter a competition for free tickets to the Super Bowl in Houston by sharing the stories of their Patriots fandom; Lou later announces their win and they prepare for their trip. On the day of their flight, the others break Maura out of her retirement home with help from her fellow resident, Mickey.
In Houston, they go to the NFL Experience, where Betty wins a chicken wing eating contest hosted by Guy Fieri, but loses the tickets. Trish meets former NFL player Dan O'Callahan and mutual attraction forms between them, but Trish is uncertain as she has not had a very successful love life; Dan invites her to a party, and the women decide to go upon learning about the loss of the tickets as Fieri will also be there. At the party, the women are given cannabis edibles which severely disorient them. Maura joins in on a game of poker in order to potentially buy new tickets, only to learn that the game is for charity; she gives her winnings to the charity of her top competitor, Gugu. Unable to find Fieri, the foursome return to their hotel.
The next day, the women go back to the NFL Experience but find it has closed down. They then go to the tailgate parties around NRG Stadium to see if they can buy any tickets from scalpers, but cannot afford them. Trish finds the radio hosts they won the tickets from and brings up the situation to them, but they are confused as they gave their tickets to a different group. Betty finds Fieri at the tailgate and recovers the bag with the tickets but when the women attempt to enter the stadium, the security guards reveal that the tickets are fake. Lou confesses that she bought the ""tickets"" online for an exorbitant price, as she wanted to have one last fun memory with her friends as she fears that her cancer may have returned. The other women console her and agree that even if they could not make it into the game, they are satisfied with all of their other memories. They run into Gugu, who sneaks them in under the guise of being backup dancers for Lady Gaga's halftime performance out of gratitude for Maura's actions the previous night.
They run into Dan who invites them into his box suite as his guests. Concerned as they watch the Atlanta Falcons build a 28–3 lead over the Patriots, they decide to sneak into the Patriots coordinators' booth. Betty hijacks the defensive coordinator's headset and gives him a playcall which leads to a sack, while Lou talks to Brady and gives him an inspirational message. The quartet return to their box suite and watch as Brady leads the Patriots to a victory. Maura reveals she made back the money Lou spent on the fake tickets by making a bet on the Patriots winning with the owner of the suite. The women are approached by security, and escorted to the Patriots' locker room, and thanked by the players for their dedication.
Three years later, Trish, Maura, Betty, and Lou, along with Mickey, and Lou's daughter Sara, prepare to watch Brady's first game with his new team the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it is revealed that Lou is in good health.[a] Sometime later, the four women sit on a beach with Brady discussing their retirements.[b]

26,Magic Mike's Last Dance,"Former male stripper Mike Lane, who lost his furniture business during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now in his forties, still in Miami and a bartender for a catering company. At Maxandra ""Max"" Mendoza's fundraising event, Mike is recognized by Kim, a woman he performed for 10 years prior, now a lawyer for Max's foundation. Afterward, Mike is asked to speak with Max privately.
Alone, Max says Kim told her about his prowess and asks how much for a lap dance. Mike says he is retired, but ultimately says $60,000 when pushed. Max says $6,000 with no 'happy ending'. The dance is very passionate, and they wake up together the next day.
The next morning, Mike refuses the $6,000, but Max offers him the $60,000 to go to London and the United Kingdom for a month for a “job”. Mike agrees but says he is done dancing. Max says it is business (no sex),  and they travel to London together. Max's ex-husband Roger gave her the Rattigan Theatre in their divorce settlement and she announces the theatrical production presently in place of the play Isabel Ascendant will be halted for one month so Mike Lane can choreograph a special dance production.
As Mike and Max discuss the logistics of this show she has come up with, her teenage daughter Zadie arrives. Distrustful of him, she explains that her mother tries to reinvent herself every few years.
Auditions for potential dancers are soon underway. An actress from the original show Isabel Ascendant shows up, wanting to participate. This inspires them to rethink the new show with elements of the original, so they cast her. Going to dinner with a few of Max's London contacts, Mike feels out of his element, and Max’s friends say she will never divorce. Later on, in the car, when Max moves toward physical intimacy with him and he pulls back, it upsets her. The next day in rehearsal, she is excessively critical of his choreography.
Max and Mike build a temporary extension of the stage, so the show has a much more palpable feel, but the City of Westminster threatens sanctions due to alterations to the historical building without prior approval. They persuade the only woman on the board, Edna Eaglebauer, to support the show. As she lives a quiet life alone, they fill her morning bus with the men from the show. Edna gets her own sample, as the 10 men do a flirty, choreographed number just for her benefit. She gives them her seal of approval.
Mike and Max argue about the ending of the show. She wants him to personalize it and finish with a happy ending. She also would really like him to dance in it, but he reiterates he is retired and will not go on stage. The show gets shut down again, so Max confronts Roger. He reminds her that their separation agreement includes a clause that she does not tarnish his family name.
After Max tells Mike to return to the United States, he gets the keys to the theater through Victor and rehearsals resume secretly. The show is not open to the general public, but rather by invitation only, as Zadie taps into her mothers' contacts. Sunday evening arrives, and Victor and Zadie drag Max out for the show she believed she had shut down; even Roger is invited.
The opening act starts the same as Isabel Ascendant, but the protagonist is offered only two possible life choices, marry the rich aristocrat or the poor one with a heart of gold. So, she calls her imaginary friend from her childhood, the unicorn, breaks the fourth wall and then talks about modern feminist ideas about what choices women should be afforded, using a golden mic that drops from above. Then Isabel's male counterparts strip off their formal attire and the other dancers are presented one by one. They have sexier and sexier numbers until the last few.
After a lap dance number for three of the more mature audience members, Mike partners with a ballet dancer for the final number. The piece, set in the rain, is reminiscent of moments shared between him and Max. Once the show is over, Mike finds Max and they kiss.

A seemingly drunk Max convinces Madeline to allow him to stay at Richard's apartment. The next day, Madeline and Richard come home to Max apparently being arrested for soliciting drugs from an undercover police officer. Madeline quickly realizes that Max is pulling a con to have Richard pay off the officer, Max's partner Tipsy. Madeline forces Max to leave the apartment. It is later revealed that Madeline and Max are not mother and son, but lovers who are targeting Richard.
Richard meets with Max, and offers him $60,000 a month to leave town. Max demands a year's salary in cash in advance in order to leave Madeline alone to be with Richard. While meeting with him, Max also meets Richard's son—Tom, who has not yet met Sandy. Max, Madeline, and Tipsy celebrate a successful job, but that evening, Madeline tells Max that Richard wants to marry her, and she will be staying with him. Max escapes from the police Madeline has called and leaves with the money.
Richard dies, leaving the vast majority of his estate to Madeline. Due to Richard's misgivings about Tom after the incident with Sandy, Tom has been left only the bookstore and a trust. He has also been named chairman of Richard's foundation, while Madeline is a trustee.
Tom hires an old family friend, Braddock, to locate ""Sandra"". Despite Madeline's attempts to convince Tom to call off the investigation, Sandy is found, heavily addicted to heroin. Tom wants her to stay at the apartment while she goes through detox, but Madeline is reticent. She speaks to Sandy, who reveals that she knows the connection between Madeline and Max. In return for her silence, Sandy demands that Madeline track down Max so she can confront him about abandoning her.
Max agrees to meet with Sandy and Madeline. During the meeting, Tom and Braddock arrive to confirm Tom's suspicions that the three had been working together. Tom pulls a gun on Sandy, then on Madeline. Sandy forces the gun out of Tom's hands, and it is picked up by Madeline, who apparently shoots and kills Tom after he forces her to point the gun at him and pull the trigger. Desperate to avoid prison, Madeline immediately transfers all the money to Richard's foundation.
Madeline, Max, and Sandy are put on a plane to Oklahoma City. Madeline reminds Max that she will retain control of the money, since Tom is dead and she is the trustee of Richard's foundation. After a distraught Sandy retreats to the plane's toilet, Madeline realizes that the blood on her sleeve is not real, meaning Tom is alive. When Madeline checks the plane's toilet, Sandy is gone.
The true nature of the scheme is revealed; having fallen in love with Tom, Sandy confesses her true identity to him, and the two devise a plan to con Madeline and Max, enlisting Tipsy and his partner Goldie—who posed as ""Braddock""—to assist them. The meeting between Sandy and Max was planned, as was Tom's apparent shooting at Madeline's hands. Since Tom is still alive, he maintains control over the foundation and the money. Tom, Sandy, Tipsy, and Goldie meet at the bookstore to celebrate their success. Tom and Sandy rekindle their relationship.

31,The Outwaters,"The film opens with a panicked 9-1-1 call along with visuals indicating that the four main cast members—Robbie, Angela, Scott, and Michelle—are missing. A title card explains that the subsequent footage was recovered from three memory cards found in the Mojave Desert.
Robbie is an aspiring filmmaker living in Los Angeles who has recruited his brother Scott and his friend Angela to help film a music video for his friend Michelle in the Mojave Desert. While getting ready for the expedition, he celebrates his brother's birthday, surprises his mother back home, parties with Angela, and talks to Michelle about her recently deceased mother. Footage filmed from Robbie's apartment of two separate earthquakes is also shown.
The four friends pack their equipment and begin their journey, spending the first night at a small lake. They continue deeper into the desert the next day and encounter a pack of donkeys blocking the road. They arrive at their final location, a small hillside area near a dried-up lakebed, and begin setting up camp. At night, the four are awakened by booming sounds and frantic animal noises that appear to be getting closer. Scott and Robbie leave their tent to investigate but find no clues. Robbie continues by himself and sees a strobing light along a hillside path.
The next day, the crew discuss the uncanny events of the previous evening and begin filming the video. During a break, Robbie and Michelle investigate the area where he saw the light and record high-pitched noises coming from a nearby hole, sensing something unusual beneath the earth. Robbie remarks that his camera battery has not gone down the entire time they've been there. Later, Robbie sees an axe at the top of a nearby hill. The crew head to the lakebed to finish filming the video, and the sound is overtaken by noises similar to the ones heard earlier in the hole. At night, the crew once again hear the booms and animal sounds. Robbie wanders off and sees a naked man on a hill wielding the axe. As he runs away, the man attacks Robbie off screen, giving him a head injury. Robbie returns to camp, bloody and disoriented, and finds Scott asleep but the women frantic.
The camera cuts to Robbie running through the desert as the two girls scream and plead for their lives. He encounters Scott and Angela, both soaked in blood. Robbie escapes and takes shelter in a small ravine until morning. He exits, naked and disoriented, and starts wandering the desert aimlessly. He finds that the area is now infested with screaming, fleshy, worm-like creatures. That night, he returns to the campsite to find the two tents covered in viscera and sees what appears to be Michelle's body. After a number of close calls with his assailant, Robbie is transported to a pool of red liquid by the light. He is taken back to the desert, vomits blood, and removes an unknown substance from his foot. He encounters the pack of donkeys, then sees himself and his three friends walking through the desert from when they first arrived. He sees a blood-soaked Michelle running across the lakebed and chases her. He encounters a bloodied Scott and Angela, acting normally, at the campsite. Exiting the tent, he finds himself at his mother's house and then on the wing of a plane, where he sees Scott through the window.
Back in the desert, in total darkness, Robbie runs into a large monster, which closely inspects him and appears to be calling to similar creatures in the distance. He runs away and sees Angela back at camp, and the two are attacked by the worms. Robbie is carried by an unseen force that transports him back into the red liquid, and the camera is shown rapidly flying through a series of white lights before returning to the desert. Robbie finds a gas mask and an old sign indicating that he is in a government-restricted area and encounters his assailant, who appears to be his doppelgänger. The next day, Robbie finds the decomposing heads of his three companions impaled on pikes. He then finds the tooth of a large animal on the ground. He uses it to sever his penis and then disembowels himself. The film ends with a shot of a fatally wounded Robbie reaching toward the sky.

32,Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"Following the Avengers's battle against Thanos,[a] Scott Lang has become a successful memoirist and has been living happily with his girlfriend, Hope van Dyne. Scott's now-teenage daughter Cassie has become an activist, helping people displaced by the Blip, resulting in her having a strained relationship with her father. While visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, Cassie reveals that she has been working on a device that can establish contact with the Quantum Realm. Upon learning of this, Janet panics and forcefully shuts off the device, but the message is received, resulting in a portal that opens and sucks the five of them into the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Hank explore a sprawling city to get answers.
Hope, Janet, and Hank meet with Lord Krylar, a former ally of Janet's, who reveals that things have changed since she left,[b] and that he is now working for Kang, the Quantum Realm's new ruler. The three are forced to flee and steal Krylar's ship. The Langs, meanwhile, are told by rebel leader Jentorra that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power. The rebels soon come under attack by Kang's forces led by M.O.D.O.K., who is revealed to be Darren Cross, having survived his apparent death at the hands of Scott,[c] and who previously received Cassie's message. Aboard Krylar's ship, Janet confesses to Hope and Hank that she met Kang when she was previously in the Quantum Realm. He claimed that he and Janet could both escape from the Quantum Realm if she helped him rebuild his multiversal power core. After they managed to repair it, Janet saw a vision of Kang conquering and destroying entire timelines. Kang revealed he was exiled by his variants out of fear, which drove Janet to turn against him. Outmatched, Janet used her Pym Particles to enlarge the power core beyond use. Kang, having regained his powers, eventually conquered the Quantum Realm afterward.
The Langs are taken to Kang, who demands that Scott help get his power core back or else he will kill Cassie. Scott is then taken to the core's location and shrinks down. In the core, he encounters a probability storm, which causes him to split into multiple copies of himself nearly overwhelming him, but Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang reneges on the deal, capturing Janet with M.O.D.O.K. destroying her ship with Hank on it. After being rescued by his ants, who rapidly evolved and became hyper-intelligent after being pulled into the Quantum Realm, Hank helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to Kang. Cassie rescues Jentorra and they commence an uprising against Kang and his army. During the fight, Cassie convinces Cross to switch sides and fight Kang, with him eventually sacrificing his life.
Janet fixes the power core as she, Hank, Hope, and Cassie jump through a portal home. Kang attacks Scott at the last minute. Before he can beat Scott into submission, Hope returns, and she and Scott throw Kang and the Pym Particles into the power core, destroying them both. Cassie reopens the portal for Scott and Hope to return home. As Scott happily resumes his life, he begins to rethink what he was told about Kang's death being the start of something terrible happening, but brushes it off. In a mid-credits scene, numerous variants of Kang, led by Immortus, commiserate Kang's death and plan their multiversal uprising. In a post-credits scene, Loki and Mobius M. Mobius encounter another Kang variant, Victor Timely, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.[d]

33,Cocaine Bear,"In 1985, drug smuggler Andrew C. Thornton II drops a shipment of cocaine from his plane. He attempts to parachute out with a drug-filled duffel bag, but knocks himself unconscious on the doorframe, causing him to fall to his death. His body lands in Knoxville, Tennessee, where he is identified by Bob, a local detective. He concludes that the cocaine is likely from St. Louis drug kingpin Syd White, and the remainder is missing. Meanwhile, in the Chattahoochee–Oconee National Forest, an American black bear eats some of the cocaine, becoming highly aggressive and attacking two hikers, Elsa and Olaf, killing the former.
In northeast Georgia, middle schooler Dee Dee lives with her mother, nurse Sari. Dee Dee skips school with her best friend Henry in order to paint a picture of the falls in the forest. On the trail to the falls, they find a lost brick of cocaine and ingest some before they are attacked by the bear. Sari ventures into the forest to search for the children with Liz, a park ranger, and Peter, a wildlife activist. They find Henry clinging to a tree, hiding from the bear. The bear attacks, sending Peter stumbling through a pile of cocaine and slashing Liz in the process. The bear tries to climb a tree and attack Henry but gets attracted to a cocaine-coated Peter. Ignoring Henry, the bear kills Peter. Sari and Henry flee deeper into the forest, and Liz sends for help.
In St. Louis, Syd sends his fixer Daveed to recover the remaining cocaine. Daveed travels to Georgia with Eddie, Syd's son, who has grown depressed following the death of his wife and has abandoned his own son. They arrive in Georgia, as does Bob. At the forest station, Daveed gets into a fight with the Duchamps gang, three delinquents who cause trouble in the forest. After Daveed beats them, one of the members, Stache, agrees to take Daveed and Eddie to recover some of the cocaine he stashed in a gazebo. Liz arrives back at the station, pursued by the bear. Liz accidentally kills Ponytail, one of the Duchamps, before the bear slaughters Vest, another of the Duchamps gang. Paramedics Beth and Tom arrive and collect Liz after a brief skirmish with the bear. They leave with Liz in an ambulance, but the bear pursues and jumps into the vehicle. In the ensuing chaos, Tom is killed by the bear, while Liz falls out of the ambulance and is dragged to death on the road. Beth loses control of the ambulance and crashes into a tree, causing her to fly through the windshield to her death.
Sari and Henry discover that Dee Dee left a trail of paint which they use to track her. Daveed and Eddie are taken to the gazebo but when they encounter Bob there with the stashed duffel of cocaine, Bob wounds Daveed. The bear appears, but Bob distracts it with the bag of coke. Bob is suddenly shot fatally by Syd, who reveals that he is under pressure from his superiors to retrieve the cocaine.
Sari and Henry find Olaf, who is mourning Elsa; Olaf leads them to Dee Dee's hiding place in the bear's cave which contains two cubs, revealing that the bear is a mother. Olaf leaves and is killed by the bear. Syd, Eddie, and Daveed find the cave, which leads out to a ledge behind the falls. The bear returns to the cave. Sari, Henry, and Dee Dee jump into the water below to safety, followed by Eddie and Daveed, who have chosen to quit the drug business together, and they all survive. However, Syd refuses to leave the bag of cocaine found in the cave. He shoots and wounds the bear but is unsuccessful in killing it and is disemboweled by the bear and her cubs.
Later, Stache hitchhikes to New York with a duffel bag of cocaine, while Eddie, accompanied by Daveed and Bob's dog, reunites with his son.

36,Jesus Revolution,"In 1968, the stern yet respected Southern California pastor, Chuck Smith, realizes his church, Calvary Chapel, is slowly dying and he is unable to connect with the younger, live-free hippie generation of teens and young adults.  His daughter, Janette, gives a ride to a colorful hippie hitchhiker named Lonnie Frisbee, who says he is traveling around and telling people about the ministry of Jesus. Smith, at first suspicious of Frisbee, eventually warms up to him and welcomes him to his church and his home.  To the dismay of Chuck and his wife, more hippies soon arrive at the Smith house.  After Lonnie introduces Chuck to a newly-formed band called Love Song, and the group performs a song in his living room, Chuck develops a new attitude toward the young people.  He and Lonnie end up joining forces and start a successful movement to evangelize hippies and other youth.

At a local campus, Greg finds Cathe is listening to Lonnie preach.  Greg approaches her and they reconcile,  with Cathe telling him she found a church and he should attend with her.  Greg and Cathe find solace at Smith and Frisbee's church, though Cathe's establishment and conservative parents are not enthusiastic about Greg.
The ministry explodes in popularity, being seen as a ""Jesus Revolution"" and the young attendees as ""Jesus freaks"".  Christian conversions and en masse group baptisms in the Pacific Ocean follow as membership at Calvary Chapel grows to such proportions that services have to be held outside under a large tent. Time magazine does a cover story on the movement in 1971 and both Lonnie and Chuck are featured on Kathryn Kuhlman's weekly television show.[5] Lonnie and his wife, Connie, start having difficulties in their marriage and Lonnie believes Chuck is trying to diminish his contribution to their joint ministry.  Lonnie eventually leaves for Florida with Connie after increasing disagreement with Chuck. Before Lonnie's departure, Greg offers to take over a ministry branch of Calvary chapel in Riverside.  He eventually marries Cathe and becomes a pastor of his own church, which becomes Harvest Fellowship. At the end of the film, the credits reveal Smith and Frisbee reconciled and both are remembered as founders of and leaders in the widespread Jesus movement that started at Calvary Chapel.

40,Creed III,"In 2002 Los Angeles, a young Adonis ""Donnie"" Creed sneaks out with his best friend, Golden Gloves champion Damian Anderson, to watch him compete in an underground boxing match. After Dame's victory, he tells Donnie about his aspirations to turn professional and become a world champion. During a detour at a liquor store, Donnie impulsively attacks a man named Leon, and Dame is arrested while Donnie escapes.
In the present day, three years after beating ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan to avenge his only career defeat, Donnie has retired from boxing to focus on his wife Bianca and their 6-year-old daughter Amara, whose hearing impairment has since led the family to become fluent in American Sign Language. Donnie runs the Delphi Boxing Academy with Tony ""Little Duke"" Evers Jr. and is promoting his protégé, world champion Felix ""El Guerrero"" Chavez, in a match against Viktor Drago. While the two watch the declining health of Donnie's adoptive mother Mary-Anne, Amara aspires to become a boxer like Donnie, which gets her into trouble in school for punching a bully.
Released from prison, Dame reconnects with Donnie and shares his desire to resume his boxing career. Donnie reluctantly invites Dame to the gym, and hires him as Chavez's sparring partner, but his presence draws scorn from Chavez and Duke as Dame is overly aggressive and hostile. Dame later visits Donnie's home, where he meets his family and recounts their time together at a group home, a story that Bianca had never heard. Privately, Dame asks for a title shot against Chavez, but Donnie declines. After Drago is attacked by an unknown assailant at a party for Bianca's record label, which casts doubt on his ability to participate in his upcoming fight, Donnie nominates Dame as Drago's replacement. Despite it being his first professional bout, Dame manages to win the unified heavyweight championship by implementing dirty tactics such as a knee and elbow, as well as targeting Chavez's shoulder, which Dame had intentionally damaged during one of their sparring sessions.
Following the match, an uneasy Donnie visits Mary-Anne, who shows him letters Dame had written to Donnie while in prison that she kept from him due to her believing that he was a bad influence. One letter contains a picture showing Dame with a fellow inmate that Donnie recognizes as Drago's assailant. Realizing that Dame planned the attack, Donnie confronts him, and Dame admits that he manipulated him into getting the title shot. Donnie is unable to open up to Bianca about his guilt over Dame, who revels in his newfound fame and publicly slanders Donnie as a fraud who turned his back on him.
Mary-Anne suffers another stroke and dies. After her funeral, Donnie confesses to Bianca about the night of Dame's arrest, revealing Leon to be the abusive caregiver in their group home before he was adopted. After Donnie attacked Leon at the liquor store, the ensuing brawl with Leon's friends caused Dame to brandish a gun. After Dame was arrested, Donnie never contacted Dame out of guilt.
Encouraged by Bianca, Donnie decides to come out of retirement and challenges Dame for the championship, which he accepts. After training with Duke and a recovered Drago, Donnie faces Dame in the ""Battle of Los Angeles"" at Dodger Stadium. The fight is a grueling, evenly-matched affair. In the final round, Donnie has visions of his abusive foster home and Dame's life in jail, which leads to Donnie being knocked down. He manages to just beat the count, then goes on to knock Dame out and regain the championship. Afterward, Donnie reconciles with Dame, with both men admitting it was not the other's fault. Donnie joins Bianca and Amara in the ring in the empty stadium, where he pretends to box with Amara. As Donnie and his family leave the ring, he looks out on to the empty Dodger Stadium.

Nathan hires super-spy Orson Fortune to lead a team made up of Sarah Fidel, JJ Davies and others. The team travels to Madrid, seeking the courier intended to transport the hard drive containing the data from the Handle. Their search is interrupted by Mike, a rival of Nathan's, who seems to have also been hired to retrieve the Handle. Sarah, an American and skilled hacker, manages to copy the hard drive's contents first. Learning that Simmonds plans to host a charity gala in Cannes, the team decides to infiltrate it by blackmailing his favorite movie star, Danny Francesco, into helping them distract Simmonds.
Simmonds invites Danny and Michaela, Sarah's cover as his girlfriend, to spend some time in his Turkish villa in Antalya. Orson infiltrates the Ukrainian mafia house to aid Sarah in hacking their computers, disguising it as a robbery. The British government warns Nathan that the Handle is an advanced AI capable of being programmed to defeat any security system in the world.  Upon learning that the exchange for the Handle will take place in Antalya, the team travels to Turkey. While Simmonds shows Danny his memorabilia, Orson and JJ work to track down one of Simmonds' moles within the Turkish government. Disguised as Simmonds' lawyer, Orson attends the exchange and finalizes it, but Mike and his men intervene, resulting in the death of almost everyone present and the theft of the Handle. This incident makes it clear that Mike has gone rogue and is working independently. Despite the problems the team has caused him, Simmonds is willing to help because Mike's theft of the Handle has cost Simmonds his commission.
Simmonds tells them that the buyers were two bio-tech moguls, Trent and Arnold, who have been hoarding gold and intend to use the Handle to cause a worldwide financial collapse. While Orson and JJ clear heavy security on ground level, Simmonds and Danny go up into the tower where Mike is finalizing the deal for the Handle with the tech moguls. Simmonds very effectively shows them how he could very easily take out their loved ones if he is not paid for the weapon. He and Danny manage to leave before everyone turns on one another. As Orson arrives, the only one left is Mike, so he takes him out and retrieves the Handle. In Doha, the team is offered another job, but they decide to go on vacation. Orson tells them he has used the proceeds from the robbery at the Ukrainians' villa to finance Danny's new film, about the film's events, with Danny playing Simmonds and Simmonds acting as an on set producer.

44,Palm Trees and Power Lines (film),"Lea is a 17-year-old girl spending the last few weeks of her summer hanging out with her best friend Amber. She lives in suburban Southern California with her emotionally absent single mother, Sandra. Lea's father is not present in her life and lives in Arizona with his new family. Lea and Amber hang out with boys their age, and Lea has a casual relationship with one of them, Jared. However, Jared only values Lea for sex and their hookups are not satisfying for her.
One night, as the group of friends eat at a diner, Lea makes eye contact with an older guy sitting at another table who winks at her on his way out. Lea's friends run out on the bill, but Lea is left behind when she hesitates to follow them. When she does try running out, a cook accosts her, but the same man from earlier intervenes and Lea is able to get away. As she walks home, the older man drives his truck alongside her and coaxes her into getting in and giving her a ride home. He introduces himself as Tom and tells Lea he is 34 years old, while Lea shares her age. Before she departs, he adds his mobile number into her cell phone.
Lea is charmed by Tom and confides to Amber that she has met someone, but doesn't disclose the details and says the guy is a boy at another school. Lea's relationship with her mom becomes further strained when she welcomes an ex-boyfriend back into their house. Lea turns to Tom for attention and validation, and he acts sympathetically to her problems, telling her that he too does not have a close relationship with his parents. When Lea asks Tom what he does for a living, he vaguely responds that he runs his own small business doing home repairs and remodeling, a job that grants him complete freedom.
Lea soon enters into a romantic relationship with Tom. When she agrees to spend the night with him, he takes her to a motel, reasoning he is temporarily staying there until he finds a new place. Lea senses something is wrong when Tom must leave the room to attend to a domestic dispute upstairs, but he insists to Lea that he was just helping out a female neighbor with her drunk boyfriend. On a day out with Tom at the beach, Lea is spotted by a friend from school, and Tom introduces himself to her. Word gets back to Amber, and Lea makes her promise not to tell anyone about their relationship. Tom also asks Lea not to see other guys, telling her affectionately, ""You're mine"". Lea appreciates feeling wanted and desired.
Lea and Tom are at a restaurant one day and the waitress suspects Lea is in a coercive relationship. When Tom steps outside to take a phone call, the waitress covertly tells Lea that if she needs to get away, she can help her. Confused and unaware that she is being groomed by Tom, Lea asks why she would need help, and the waitress mentions that Tom frequents the eatery with other young girls. When Tom returns, he can sense Lea's unease and gets her to talk about what's troubling her. When she confesses the waitress said she's seen him before with other girls, he plays it off and claims she must have him mistaken with someone else.
Later, while Lea is out drinking and smoking with friends, Jared mockingly jokes she has been seen ""hanging out with the geriatric"". Lea, angry that Amber is the one who told Jared, storms off and shows up distraught at Tom's motel room. Tom comforts Lea by telling her he loves her and reassuring her that her friends and family's opinions don't matter. He also gifts her a bracelet inscribed with an inside joke they share. When he asks if she wants to go on a vacation with him, Lea agrees without hesitation and the two head to a hotel. On their second night at the hotel, Tom sits Lea down and asks her if she can do something for him. He says she needs to sleep with another man for money, and if she loves him she'll do it for him. Having coerced her into prostitution, he leaves her with a middle-aged man. The unnamed man coaxes a reluctant Lea into oral and vaginal sex. While the man is in the shower, an emotional Lea packs her things and leaves the room, but Tom catches her in an embrace before she can leave the hotel.
Tom takes her to get food at a restaurant, and Lea uses an excuse to go to the restroom as an opportunity to leave, walking to a nearby gas station by herself. She tearfully calls Amber to come pick her up, and when she arrives the two reconcile. At home, Lea makes an effort to spend more time with her mother and returns to her usual activities with Amber. After Amber compliments Lea's bracelet, she feels compelled to try and phone Tom several times, but his mobile number is disconnected. She goes to the motel and knocks on his door, but it goes unanswered. She inquires about Tom's whereabouts from an upstairs tenant she had seen Tom helping out before, and the girl reluctantly dials his number and puts her through to Tom. Lea sobs into the phone and asks why Tom abandoned her. The film ends with Lea's affirmations of her feelings for Tom and she smiles hearing him reciprocate his love for her.

45,The Year Between,"In her sophomore year at college, Clemence Miller (Heller) has alienated everyone with her erratic behavior. After incurring a manic bout of bullying, her miserable roommate, Eliza (Blim), notifies the administration and her craft store proprietress mother, Sherri (Smith-Cameron), of Clemence's disparaging attitude and mood swings. This prompts Sherri to wrangle her daughter into quitting school and compel her to begrudgingly return home, whereupon she discovers her old bedroom has been converted into a home office. Instead, she'll be ""banished"" to the furnished basement.
Upon visiting a psychiatrist (Buck), Clemence is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and is prescribed a regimen of medication beginning with lithium to balance her oscillating mania and depression episodes, which will require experimental adjustments. Initially, she is defiant and reluctant, but an exasperated Sherri encourages her.
Meanwhile, she receives a tepid welcome from the rest of the family. Her father, local schoolteacher Don (Buscemi), attempts to be relentlessly positive, while her younger siblings are far less enthused. Her sister, Carlin (Robinson), fears Clemence's attributes will be imparted unto her, and thus strives to achieve high ACT scores to prevent this. Her brother, Neil (Oleff), is trepidatious about being absorbed into Clemence's unstable orbit, and retains an ambivalent attitude when in her presence.
Undeterred, Clemence begins attending sessions with a psychologist (Odom) and lands a job part-time at a thrift store. She forges a strained connection with co-worker Beth (Simone), and manages to stay sober from alcohol and illicit drugs. However, upon reconnecting with erstwhile partying pal, Ashik (Jacob), Clemence begins to jeopardize her progress and runs the risk of losing what little support she has left.

Her ex-boyfriend Charlie greets her as she comes to and professes his love for her. He shows her videos he took when they were together and tells her he wants her back or else he will have no choice but to kill her.
Back in Florida, Sam cuts the call and heads inside to work at an alligator gas station.

While hiding in the woods, Emily call 911 but the response team informs her it could take a while to find her and can't video call her to help to safety because of their strict policies. She tries to call back but accidentally calls Sam from the missed call log who tells her she is sorry she called the wrong number earlier. Emily explains her situation to Sam and begs her for help. Sam, suffering from anxiety and stress initially contemplates whether to video-call Emily but commits to helping her.
Using video call, Sam guides Emily through the woods whilst also looking out for a vengeful Charlie. While on the call, Emily and Sam start to bond while discussing their difficult family situations. Emily wanted to be an ER nurse like her mother and so she could help provide for her but due to her busy schedule, doesn't spend enough time together. Sam left Jacksonville to move to Tallahassee to care for her sick mother, who has now passed and Emily assures her that her mother would have been happy she was with her at the end.
Sam accidentally gets her charger connector stuck in the cellphone port and with her distraction, Emily falls off a ledge and onto the beach by the river, losing her phone in the process. Although her ear-piece is still connected.

Sam reminds her of the piece of broken mirror she put in her pocket from earlier and Emily uses this to stab Charlie in the neck, killing him as sirens approach the barn. Meanwhile, the police arrive at the gas station to arrest Sam. Seeing that Emily is safe, Sam gleefully surrenders and is taken into custody.

47,Craving (2023 film),"Police officers Shaw and Washington enter a rural bar, The Last Exit, following what appears to be a bloody massacre. They find one female survivor, Shiloh, too scared to speak to them.
Flashing back to the night before, The Last Exit is having a typical evening. Les, the owner and bartender, contends with Rudy, a conspiracy theorist who lusts over Shiloh, the other bartender. Travis, a cowboy and swindler, challenges Rudy to a game of pool but is distracted by local DJ Rylee, who rebuffs his advances. A suspicious man in the corner named Jared watches over the bar before Cece enters. Cece asks to borrow Travis' car, which he is opposed to as Cece is with another man, Frank. Travis relents and Cece does drugs in the bathroom, unaware that John is in one of the stalls. The patrons are startled by the sound of gunshots outside. Les takes a baseball bat to scare of what she assumes are kids with firecrackers, but is shot in the head by the crossfire.
Five violent heroin addicts force their way into the bar: Gail, Mac, Will, Lo, and Frenzy. After they assume control of the bar it becomes apparent that a second group outside is after them. This group wears flesh masks and violently murders Frank after pulling him out of his car. The lieutenant of the group, Red, uses a megaphone to coerce the people inside to give up one of their own, who they deem is a monster, before his group begins barricading the bar. Inside, Shiloh weeps over Les' body, and Gail forces her and the patrons to stand together by the pool table while Mac checks the bar for other entrances. John successfully hides under the bathroom sink. At the bar, Gail watches the group outside over the CCTV, recognizing their leader as Hunter, who removes his mask and taunts the group inside. Will is suffering from withdrawals, worse than any of the others, and he rests behind the bar. The addicts struggle to maintain control over the patrons, leading to Frenzy assaulting Travis and Rudy. Cece plots to turn the addicts against each other, but Frenzy catches on and beats her up in the bathroom.
Through flashbacks it's revealed that a man named Carl rescued Gail from a drug den, and she became the adoptive mother to his adoptive son, Will, who suffered a condition that only heroin would remedy. Mac serves as Carl's number two, and only very recently did the group meet Frenzy and Lo, who are a couple. Lo calms Frenzy's hot demeanor, though Lo herself is deeply disturbed and admits to having murdered animals in her youth. It's revealed that Carl was dating Hunter's ex-wife, and that Hunter is Will's real father. A monster murdered Hunter's ex-wife, leading him down a rabbit hole chasing clue after clue, trying to find this creature. Eventually Hunter discovered what Carl was up to, and after making arrangements with Red's people and secretly colluding with Frenzy to trap Carl's group at The Last Exit, Hunter shot and killed Carl immediately preceding the events of the story.
Inside the bar, tensions between the group escalate. Cece accidentally gets Frenzy to reveal her betrayal to Gail, giving Cece the opportunity to steal Gail's revolver. As Cece attempts to take control of the situation, Lo sneaks up behind her and beats her to death with a pool cue. Exposed, Frenzy and Lo attempt to kill Mac, but Frenzy accidentally shoots Lo. Will is shot in the crossfire, and Gail comforts him until his passes away. Suddenly, Will's body begins to twist and contort, terrifying the patrons of the bar. It is clear that Will is the monster, leading Frenzy and Rylee to attempt to escape. Will fully transforms into a large, slimy creature covered in bodily spikes and sharp teeth protruding from his face. Will immediately rips apart Frenzy before turning on the patrons, killing Jared, Travis, and Rylee. Shiloh tries to hide under a pool table, and Rudy sacrifices himself to save her. Gail attempts to calm Will, hoping underneath the monster that he's still there. Her words fail, and Mac attempts to kill Will before being torn apart himself. The last one standing, Gail succumbs to her death at Will's monstrous hands.
Will finds John hiding in the bathroom and tears him apart before returning to the pool table where Shiloh is hiding. He scratches her arm in an attempt to reach her, but after consuming so much he's become weakened, and Shiloh impales him with the broken pool cue. Will transforms back to normal, apologizing to Shiloh. Before he dies he tells her he became the monster after he was scratched by one. Outside Red sends in Lori and Gerry to investigate the bar. Shiloh stabs Gerry but Lori shoots her. As Lori looms over Shiloh, her eyes transform and she kills Lori. Outside, Hunter and Red are shocked as they see Shiloh, now in monster form, break through the barricades and murder Red and the rest of his group.

48,Scream VI,"One year after the Woodsboro killings orchestrated by Richie Kirsch and Amber Freeman,[a] Blackmore University professor Laura Crane is catfished and murdered by her student Jason Carvey wearing a Ghostface costume because of him blaming her for failing. Jason plots with his boyfriend Greg to kill sisters Sam and Tara Carpenter to finish the ""movie"" that Richie (a classmate of theirs) and Amber wanted to make. However, Jason receives a call from a different Ghostface, who has killed Greg and subsequently stabs Jason to death.
Sam and Tara now live in New York City, with Tara attending Blackmore University alongside fellow survivors Chad and Mindy Meeks-Martin, their roommate Quinn Bailey, Mindy's girlfriend Anika Kayoko, and Chad's roommate Ethan Landry. Sam attends therapy with Dr. Christopher Stone and has become a public pariah because of an online conspiracy theory that she was the true mastermind of the recent killings. Quinn's father, Detective Wayne Bailey, calls Sam in for questioning as her ID was found at the scene of Jason's murder, along with a Ghostface mask worn by Richie and Amber. On the way to the station, Ghostface calls Sam from Richie's phone, who then attacks Tara and kills multiple bystanders in a bodega, and leaves behind another Ghostface mask worn in the 2011 Woodsboro killings.
At the NYPD police station, the sisters meet with FBI special agent Kirby Reed, a survivor of the 2011 killings,[b] and reporter Gale Weathers, who has since written a new book on the previous Woodsboro killings despite promising the Carpenter sisters that she would not.[a] She tells them she spoke to Sidney Prescott and that she has gone into hiding to protect her family. Dr. Stone is murdered by Ghostface, who steals Sam's file and leaves behind a mask worn in the Hollywood killings. Mindy theorizes that the killer is following the rules of film franchises, specifically the rule that anyone can die while the franchise will still continue. From his window, Sam's boyfriend Danny witnesses Ghostface stabbing Quinn in Sam and Tara's apartment before attacking the group and killing Anika, leaving behind a mask worn in the Windsor College killings. Gale takes the group to an abandoned theater she found while investigating, which has been set up as a shrine to the Ghostface killers, featuring many items of evidence related to previous massacres now displayed like film props.
Ghostface calls Gale at her apartment and torments her about the death of Dewey Riley before killing her boyfriend and attacking her. Sam and Tara arrive just in time to stop Ghostface from killing Gale, who is taken to the hospital. The group agrees to meet Kirby at the theater to trap Ghostface. Mindy is stabbed by Ghostface on the train. At the theater, Sam sees a hallucination of her father, original Ghostface killer Billy Loomis. Taking his knife from the original murders,[c] she realizes they have been locked inside. Two Ghostfaces appear and attack Chad. Wayne and Kirby both arrive with guns drawn and he shoots her, revealing himself as a third Ghostface and the mastermind. His accomplices are his children, revealed to be Ethan and a still-alive Quinn, who faked her death to ease suspicion. They reveal their motive is to take revenge on Sam for killing Richie,[a] who was their brother and Wayne's first-born son. They defamed Sam online and infiltrated her life with the intent of killing her. Sam and Tara ultimately gain the upper hand and fight them off, with Tara stabbing Ethan and Sam killing Quinn while briefly rendering Wayne unconscious. Sam then dons her father's Ghostface costume, taunts Wayne with a phone call, and stabs him to death. Ethan resurfaces, but Kirby smashes a television set over his head, killing him.
Sam agrees to let Tara live her life more independently, and Tara agrees to go to therapy. As Mindy, Chad, and Kirby are taken to the hospital, Sam stares at her father's Ghostface mask before discarding it and following Tara and Danny into the city.

49,65 (film),"Sixty-five million years ago, on the planet Somaris, pilot Mills is convinced by his wife that he should take on a two-year space expedition to earn the money needed to treat their daughter Nevine's illness. During the journey, his spaceship, the Zoic, is hit by a mass of asteroids and crash-lands on the alien-to-him planet, Earth. With his ship damaged beyond repair, he finds that his passengers have been killed and contemplates suicide until he finds a lone survivor, a young girl named Koa. Mills sends a distress beacon for rescue and decides to take care of Koa. However, they have difficulty communicating due to differing languages and a broken translator.
Mills later discovers a functioning escape shuttle from the Zoic has landed on top of a mountain. To encourage Koa to follow him, Mills lies about her family being atop the mountain, when in reality they perished in the crash. The pair quickly realize the planet is home to dangerous and aggressive alien creatures, which are actually Earth's dinosaurs. As Mills protects Koa, they begin to bond.
Koa watches several video messages sent by Nevine. The two are attacked by what appears to be a massive theropod, though Mills shoots it in the eye, which enrages it, forcing Koa and Mills to retreat further into a cave. After a rockfall separates them, Mills is attacked by an Oviraptor and Koa is attacked by a raptor-like creature which she traps in a fallen tree log; she uses bombs Mills had given her to kill the dinosaur. Mills kills the Oviraptor and escapes the cave, but falls into quicksand while searching for Koa. Koa rescues him and they continue up the mountain. Mills discovers that a huge asteroid, the same one whose debris his ship crashed into, will strike Earth in less than 12 hours.
The two reach the escape shuttle, but Koa is angry when she discovers that Mills lied to her. Mills opens up to Koa about losing Nevine, who had died of her illness while he was away, and promises to protect her. Upon learning rescue is on the way, the two board the escape shuttle, but the asteroid's debris causes it to fall down the mountain. A pair of marauding Tyrannosaurus rex harass Mills and Koa, though Mills successfully kills both of them. Suddenly, the same predator Mills had partially blinded earlier, which turns out to resemble a hybrid of a theropod and a rauisuchid, also attacks. Mills manages to lure it toward a large geyser field while Koa stabs it in its remaining good eye with a large dinosaur claw that she coated in poison berries earlier, blinding it. The now-blind carnivore then stumbles headfirst into a boiling hot geyser and is burned to death. The pair escapes just in time as the asteroid strikes Earth, causing a cataclysmic event and the extinction of the dinosaurs. With the pod set to meet up with a rescue vessel, the two relax and fly off into the stars.
In closing titles, the evolution of Earth is shown, at the spot where Mills and Koa left, through an ice age until the present day.

50,Champions (2023 film),"Marcus Marakovich, a hot-tempered but skilled assistant coach for a minor league basketball team in Iowa, lets his temper get the best of him during a game and shoves the head coach, Phil. After leaving the stadium, he gets drunk at a bar and while driving home hits a police car, ending up in jail. The next day he is bailed out by Phil. He gets into an argument with him, believing he was right and if Phil had listened, none of the previous night would have happened. Phil explains why he didn't listen and advises Marcus to get to know the players more, that they have personal lives that affect their playing. Phil then informs Marcus that the team owners have let Marcus go.
When Marcus appears for his hearing, the judge gives him a choice of 18 months in prison, or 90 days community service with a basketball team for people who have learning disabilities: ""The Friends."" He agrees to community service and soon realizes coaching this team will be a personal and professional challenge. At the end of the first practice, he accepts a ride home with Johnny, one of the players. However, Marcus learns that Johnny is driven by his sister, Alex, who Marcus previously met through Tinder and shared a one-night stand with.
The team begins to improve and as Marcus gets to know the players personally, he realizes that they are more than players on a basketball court. When one of the team members, Darius, refuses to play for Marcus, Marcus puts Consentino, a previously injured player, back into the rotation. The team is kicked off the bus when the team ""disrupts"" the other passengers and Johnny calls his sister Alex to pick them up in her Shakespeare travel van. Fortunately, Marcus and the team eventually convince Alex to drive The Friends to scheduled away games. Marcus and Alex begin a casual relationship.
Johnny becomes more attached to Marcus and invites him to dinner. Once there, Marcus shares Johnny's news about moving into a shared house with some of The Friends. Alex becomes defensive and tells Marcus to stay out of family business, causing Marcus to leave the home. While Alex is confronting Marcus in the yard, he realizes that Alex quietly uses her daily routine taking care of Johnny as an excuse to break up with boyfriends before Johnny can grow attached to them. Following this, Alex tells Marcus their relationship is over. Johnny becomes angry with Marcus for hurting Alex and lying to him. Johnny refuses to play for The Friends. During the halftime of a game, Consentino tells Johnny to get over his issues with Marcus since members of The Friends play for each other, not for Marcus.
Marcus asks Sonny, one of the assistant coaches with his former team, and who has an uncle that is a manager with the NBA, to help Marcus find a new job with the big league. Although Sonny's uncle refuses to help, Sonny leads Marcus on for a while, hoping they will become friends, until he realizes that Marcus was just being nice to him to get an NBA job. When Marcus realizes how manipulative he's been, he asks Sonny to help him with coaching The Friends and Marcus agrees.
Benny, a member of The Friends and who works at a restaurant, has been unable to play in games because his boss refuses to allow him to adjust his schedule. Once the team is able to make it to the semifinals, he tells his boss he should be able to adjust his schedule to play with the team and is fired, but he is now able to play and is one of the key scorers. Marcus and Phil meet by chance in a restaurant and Phil lets Marcus know that Darius, the teammate who refuses to play for Marcus, had a promising career before he was involved in a terrible car accident and ended up with brain damage. Marcus realizes it was a drunk driver who hit Darius and goes to his home to apologize and explain he would never drive drunk again, but that he understands why Darius won't play for him. Darius, realizing he needs to be able to forgive the woman that hit him, decides to begin with Marcus and agrees to go to the Special Olympics finals in Winnipeg.
Marcus receives news he has been hired by the NBA expansion team in Seattle as a third assistant, but Alex tells him they are using his feel-good story as a cover for their scandal. When he tells The Friends he is moving to Seattle, they cannot bring themselves to be happy, knowing it will take him away, and Johnny becomes angry with him again. Marcus is told by the community center manager, Julio, that the city do not have the money to send the players to Canada, so Marcus devises a scheme with Alex to blackmail the owner of the restaurant where Benny worked, and so they are able to get the necessary funds to attend the finals.
In the finals, The Friends are intimidated by the size and name of the opposing team, The Beasts, and it shows in their playing, so when they are down during the halftime, Marcus brings up all the situations that they've conquered and calls them Champions. When returning to the court, Johnny proceeds up the stairs to have his ""Champion"" moment by telling Alex he is moving in with his friends.
The Friends rally during the second half and are within one point of winning, so Marcus tries to set up a play that will have Darius making the final shot. His assistant coach Sonny says it's a bad idea as the other team knows Darius is the best player and they will be all over him. Marcus begins to reprimand him like Phil had done to him but catches himself and realizes the assistant is right and sets up a pick and roll play with Johnny. The play works and Johnny is about to make the basket when another player, Showtime, yells he is open and Johnny passes him the ball, only for Showtime to make his trademark move of a backward shot. He misses the basket but hits the rim, and the team goes wild because he had never before hit the rim. It results in the team's loss, but they still see themselves as Champions because of Marcus's pep talk.
Marcus decides not to take the Seattle job, realizing that Alex was right, and is offered a local coaching job at Drake University. His former assistant takes over the coaching of The Friends, Marcus and Alex begin dating, and Johnny moves in with his friends at the shared house.
A post-credit sequence shows the Friends playing a game where Showtime finally converts on a backward shot, with his teammates celebrating with him.

51,Chang Can Dunk,"Xiao Ming ""Bernard"" Chang is an unpopular sophomore in high school. He hangs out with his band friend Bo but expresses huge interest in basketball, with whom he shares a rivalry with star player Matt O'Neil, his former friend from elementary school. One day, he meets his new bandmate Kristy and becomes smitten with her, only for Matt to start hitting on her. Chang continues to feel threatened by Matt, especially when his friends lock him in the basement at a house party. He escapes and confronts Matt over a prior basketball game and claims that he can dunk, but Matt puts him down and he's humiliated when he falls into a swimming pool.
Chang continues his quest to reinvent himself, especially since his mother Chen always judges his decisions, leading him to not opening up to her. He finally confronts Matt at school and bets that he can make a dunk by homecoming. Should Chang win, Matt must shave his head and give him his prized Kobe Bryant jersey. Should Matt win, not only must Chang shave his head, but also give him his first edition ""shadowless"" Charizard Pokémon Trading Card. Kristy knows full well that the bet is really about her, but chooses to support Chang regardless. Bo helps Chang train rigorously, but after a week, feels that he hasn't accomplished much. He goes online and discovers Deandre Cooke, a YouTuber who films himself dunking.
Chang meets Deandre at a Verizon store and Deandre agrees to take him on as his protégé. Seeing as how they cannot pay him, Bo instead offers to improve his YouTube videos, calling their production terrible. He agrees. Chang improves significantly as Deandre films and uploads his exploits online and the two form a bond. Chang asks Deandre why he never went pro and he says sometimes life just doesn't go the way you want it to. At the same time, Chang and his mother start to feel distant. The day before the dunk, Chang feels that he's still off and sneaks into the school late at night. In the morning, everyone gathers to see Chang's dunk attempt and after large fanfare, succeeds, winning the bet and earning him school fame.
Despite his online recognition, Chen remains in the dark about her son's success. He's invited by ESPN to New York to talk about his win and brings Bo, Kristy and Deandre with him. When he's asked to make the dunk again, he misses, claiming that the wind threw him off. However, Chang is swallowed up by his fame and nearly ditches his friends. At school the next day, Matt says he knew that Chang cheated by lowering the basket on the court. Chang accuses him of racism and they get into a fight, resulting in both boys getting suspended for a week. Chen finally learns what Chang has been up to and angrily tells him that he doesn't need to prove himself to others, while Chang says he can never talk to her because she's always unhappy and makes everyone else unhappy. Chang realizes that he cannot make a dunk and publicly apologizes for his cheating.
Chen confronts Deandre over the time he spent with Chang, but he tells her that he was a great kid whom he truly believes in. Realizing that her son has potential, Chen goes home and destroys her house's unfinished veranda from her separated husband. Chang helps her and repairs their relationship. Chang makes up with Bo and Kristy, the latter of whom he starts dating. He tries out for the school basketball team and makes up with Matt, with both of them becoming better people. Sometime later, Chang is on the basketball team and his coach tells him to enter a game. While he briefly makes a mistake, he steals the ball from an opposing player and dribbles down the court, rising for a dunk before the film ends as the crowd cheers.

53,Shazam! Fury of the Gods,"Four years after Thaddeus Sivana's defeat[b] Hespera and Kalypso, daughters of the Titan Atlas, break into the Acropolis Museum in Athens, Greece and steal the Wizard's broken staff.[c] They take it to the Wizard, who was imprisoned in the Gods' Realm, and force him to repair the staff to reactivate its powers.
In Philadelphia, Billy Batson and his ""Shazamily"" are drifting apart as they grow up and pursue their own interests. Billy is worried about being kicked out of the Vasquez family when he turns eighteen. In a dream, the Wizard warns Billy about the Daughters of Atlas, prompting the Shazamily to begin researching them.
Freddy Freeman meets a new girl named Anne, to whom he shows off his superhero self. Hespera and Kalypso arrive with the staff and steal Freddy's powers, and Anne is revealed to be their youngest sister, Anthea. Billy and the Shazamily attempt to save Freddy, but the daughters kidnap him and place an indestructible dome around the city, trapping everyone inside. Freddy is imprisoned with the Wizard in the Gods' Realm.
The Shazamily enter the Rock of Eternity, where they encounter a sentient pen named Steve, which they use to draft a letter to negotiate with Hespera for Freddy's release. Billy meets Hespera at a local restaurant, and, while the meeting is initially cordial, she and Kalypso soon fight the Shazamily. Pedro loses his powers during the fight, while Hespera is captured and taken to the Rock. Having planned her capture, Hespera easily breaks out and steals the Golden Apple, the seed of the Tree of Life. Meanwhile, Freddy and the Wizard attempt to escape the Gods' Realm with a sympathetic Anthea's help, just as Hespera returns with the Apple. The Daughters argue as Hespera and Anthea want to use the Apple to revive their realm, while Kalypso wishes to plant it on Earth to destroy it. Freddy steals the Apple but is discovered. Billy and the Shazamily show up, and Freddy reacquires his powers.
Billy and the Shazamily emerge with the Wizard in the Vasquez home, where they reveal their secret identities to their foster parents. Kalypso appears with a dragon named Ladon to acquire the Apple and destroy the Vasquez house. The family attempts to keep the apple away from Kalypso, but everyone except Billy loses their powers in the skirmish. Kalypso retrieves the Apple and uses it to plant the Tree at Citizens Bank Park, which spawns various monsters to attack the city. Hespera and Anthea object to their sister's destructive plan, but Kalypso mortally wounds Hespera and de-powers Anthea. Billy, in despair, asks the Wizard to revoke his powers, but the Wizard assures him that he is a true hero who is worthy of them.
Heeding the Wizard's words, Billy flies off to stop Kalypso, while the Shazamily enlists the help of unicorns to fend off the other monsters. Billy persuades a dying Hespera to help him stop Kalypso. Realizing the dome reacts violently to his lightning, Billy lures Kalypso to the park while Hespera shrinks the dome to contain them. Billy sacrifices himself to stop Kalypso and Ladon by overloading the staff with electricity, destroying the Tree and Kalypso's army with them. Hespera acknowledges Billy as a true god before succumbing to her wounds, causing the dome to disappear.
Anthea takes Billy's grieving family to the Gods' Realm for his burial. Diana Prince, the Amazon princess with godly powers, appears and repairs the staff, imbuing it with her power and using it to revive the Gods' Realm, restore Anthea's powers, and resurrect Billy. Billy, in turn, uses the staff to restore his siblings' powers. The Shazamily rebuild their home while Anthea and Freddy start a relationship and the Wizard takes up residence on Earth.
In a mid-credits scene, Emilia Harcourt and John Economos attempt to recruit Billy into the Justice Society on behalf of Amanda Waller, but he declines.
In a post-credits scene, a still-incarcerated Sivana encounters Mister Mind once again, enraged that he has not begun enacting their plan.

54,Boston Strangler (film),"In 1962, Boston Record American reporter Loretta McLaughlin investigates three cases of older women who were raped and murdered by strangulation in the Boston area. She confirms the victims all had stockings tied around their necks in a bow, probably connecting the crimes to a serial killer. The story angers Boston law enforcement as well as Loretta's boss, who plans to kill the report to protect the company.
When a fourth victim is found, Loretta and fellow reporter Jean Cole decide to continue the investigation. The two women endure rampant sexism in their workplace and society. Loretta's marriage is strained by her long hours and her family is harassed. While writing the articles, Loretta coins the name ""the Boston Strangler"".
One year later, a seventh woman named Sophie Clark is murdered. A neighbor encountered a man who could be the killer and she provides a vague description. Sophie was much younger than previous victims, which breaks the Strangler's pattern. Loretta and Jean later discover that the Boston Police Department is botching the investigation and not sharing information with other cities. Similar murders, like one committed in New York City by a man named Paul Dempsey, have been overlooked.
Albert DeSalvo, a suspect in the investigation, is taken into custody. Sophie's neighbor is asked to identify him in a line-up but she picks a different man, George Nassar. Despite this, in 1964, DeSalvo confesses to all 13 murders. Police do not have enough evidence to tie him to the murders, so he is instead convicted for earlier crimes of robbery and sexual offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment.
By 1965, Loretta learns from a police detective in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that there have been six murders there that are identical to the Boston Strangler's work. She travels to Ann Arbor and learns the most likely suspect is Daniel Marsh, an ex-boyfriend of a Strangler victim. Marsh is later arrested but refuses to cooperate with police. In 1973, DeSalvo calls Loretta and tells her to come to visiting hours the next day to hear his side of the story. Before Loretta can meet with him, he is stabbed to death by another prisoner.
Following an anonymous tip, Loretta meets with Harrison, a former patient at Bridgewater State Hospital. He reveals that DeSalvo, Marsh and Nassar were all held in the same ward at the same time. Harrison also claims DeSalvo's confession was coached by Marsh and Nassar. Loretta visits Nassar in prison. He denies that he and Marsh coached DeSalvo but admits he hoped to claim the reward. He accuses Loretta and the media of creating a sensation around the Strangler and insinuates that there is more than one murderer but that the public does not want to come to terms with it.
Loretta and Jean create a theory that Paul Dempsey killed the first six older women in Boston before he moved to New York. Once Dempsey left Boston, copycat murders arose, resulting in the later victims being much younger. DeSalvo confessed to all 13 murders so Nassar could collect a $10,000 reward per victim. In return, Nassar arranged for DeSalvo to be represented by high-profile lawyer F. Lee Bailey. DeSalvo was also deceived into believing he would get a million-dollar book deal that could support his family. The Record American publishes Loretta and Jean's theory.
An epilogue tells of Loretta becoming an award-winning medical reporter at The Boston Globe. Jean continued working as an investigative reporter for 30 years. She and Loretta remained close friends. Marsh was never charged with murder. Nassar never received a reward and is incorrectly said to still be in prison as of 2023.[a] In 2013, DNA evidence linked DeSalvo to the 13th murder but not the other 12.

58,Supercell (film),"Bill and Quinn Brody are legendary storm chasers. When they have a child, William, Quinn decides to stay home and monitor the situations while Bill goes on the storm chases. During a storm chase, Quinn pleads with Bill to get out of the ""bears cage"" as the system is exploding. However he ignores her and he and two college students are killed by the tornado.
Several years later, Quinn is a house cleaner living in Florida assisted by the teenage William. William has been friends for years with Harper, who is teaching him how to drive. William has interest in storm chasing which Quinn is trying to discourage. One day he goes to the roof of his high school with an instrument invented by his parents that is supposed to find tornadoes by a sound frequency, and is subsequently expelled. After receiving his parents chase log in the mail from his dad's former chase partner Roy Cameron who was like an uncle to William, William hitchhikes to Oklahoma to the return address on the envelope. When he meets up with Roy, Roy at first wants to send him home, but acquiesces for him to tag along on a chase.
William finds out that Roy is an employee of Brody Storm Chase Tours, operated by the acerbic Zane Rogers who uses the legend of the Brody name to lure clients into purchasing tours. He grudgingly allows William along with the other ""tourists"" and is shown to take chances as he tells Roy to pull off the road into a muddy field where they witness a tornado forming in the distance. However another part of the storm forms right over them and they take shelter in the van which is stuck in the mud as it is pelted with large hail. This forces Roy to head to a garage a couple hours away to retrieve their back-up van. Meanwhile Quinn has contacted Roy as she figures William is with him. She and Harper head west in Harper's car to track him down.
When Roy returns with the van, he and Zane are forced to leave William behind at a gas station when a super cell forms nearby. However a tornado forms right over the gas station and William rides it out in a phone booth. When the press shows up to interview William, Zane attempts to use the spotlight to promote his storm chasing tour, causing Roy to punch him and then quit. Roy and William head to a warehouse where William shows Roy the tornado frequency instrument, while Roy shows him his dad's original storm chasing vehicle. They then go witness what it looks like at night in the back of a super cell and it's incredible lightning display.
The next morning as many chase crews congregate at a diner, Roy tells William that his mom is coming to get him and he is to stay there. When Roy leaves the table, William sneaks out and joins with Zane and his latest storm tourists. They head to an area where a large super cell is forming, and when Quinn and Harper arrive at the diner they head after them with Roy. Zane stops the van on a hill and when William walks a distance away the tornado frequency instrument reveals a tornado bearing down on them. With the van stuck in the mud, William drives the car in reverse as Zane pushes it out of the mud and is subsequently sucked into the tornado. Driving in reverse William narrowly escapes the tornado and just misses hitting the vehicle containing Roy, Quinn and Harper. Running low on gas and with another large tornado heading towards them they head for shelter in a nearby town. When William goes back to the van to retrieve his father's wrist watch, the others go after him and are cut off from the shelter by the approaching tornado. They dive into a swimming pool and survive despite the van being tossed into the pool. The next morning William and Harper confirm their romantic feelings for each other and Quinn tells William how proud his father would be.

60,John Wick: Chapter 4,"In New York City, John Wick prepares to exact vengeance against the High Table while hiding underground with the Bowery King. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder, the ""one who sits above the Table"". In response, High Table member Marquis Vincent Bisset de Gramont summons New York Continental hotel manager Winston and his concierge Charon, where he explains that the High Table has given him unlimited resources to kill John and chastises Winston for previously failing to do so. As punishment, the Marquis strips Winston of his managerial duties, declares him ""excommunicado"", destroys the New York Continental and executes Charon. The Marquis then enlists Caine – a blind, retired High Table assassin – to kill his old friend John, threatening to murder Caine's daughter.
John takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, run by his friend Shimazu Koji. The Marquis' second-in-command Chidi, backed by High Table assassins and Caine, arrives to investigate the hotel. Koji's daughter Akira, the hotel's concierge, evacuates the hotel just before the High Table ""deconsecrates"" it, igniting a melee. John fights through waves of armored assassins, leading to a showdown against Caine. A bounty hunter named Mr. Nobody interrupts their fight and allows John to escape after determining the current bounty for killing John to be insufficient. A wounded Koji repeatedly attacks Caine on John's behalf, until Caine reluctantly kills Koji, but spares Akira.
John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests that John invoke an old High Table tradition to challenge the Marquis to a duel. Winning would free John of all obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. John travels to the Berlin headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, with whom he had severed ties, to request readmission. His adoptive sister Katia stipulates that for readmission, John must kill Killa Harkan, a High Table member who murdered her father. Killa sets up an ambush at his nightclub, but with the aid of Caine and Mr. Nobody, John manages to kill him and regain his status. Winston relays John's challenge to the Marquis, acting as John's 'second' and requests that, should John win, his excommunicado to be revoked and the New York Continental be rebuilt, fully funded by the High Table; should John lose, however, Winston would also die as the challenger's 'second'.
In Paris, John and the Marquis decide on the duel's parameters – dueling pistols at sunrise the following day at Sacré-Cœur – in a meeting moderated by the Harbinger, the Table's emissary. The Marquis nominates a reluctant Caine to take his place, while the Harbinger warns that both John and Winston will be executed should either fail to appear on time. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol (9mm Pit Viper) and a new ballistic suit. The Marquis intends to prevent John from arriving at the duel in time by placing a $26 million bounty on him. John fights off hordes of assassins on his way to Sacré-Cœur, including Mr. Nobody, who negotiates a bounty increase to $40 million. During their confrontation, John prevents Chidi from killing Mr. Nobody's dog, causing Mr. Nobody to abandon his pursuit of John.
After Caine and Mr. Nobody assist John in fighting off several assassins – including Chidi, whom Mr. Nobody kills – on the Rue Foyatier, they reach the summit just in time for the duel. John and Caine wound each other through two rounds of dueling, and the third round comes to a halt when Caine severely wounds John. Demanding the right to administer the coup de grâce, the Marquis eagerly swaps places with Caine. Winston chides the Marquis for his arrogance, revealing that John has not yet fired his third bullet. John then promptly executes the Marquis with a headshot, ending the duel. The Harbinger grants Caine and John their freedom from the High Table and Winston's reinstatement of Hotel Manager of the New York Continental, which will be rebuilt with the High Table's funds. John reflects upon his life and marriage before succumbing to his injuries. Sometime later, back in New York, Winston and the Bowery King bid farewell to John at his grave, located next to that of his wife Helen.[a]
In a post-credits scene, Caine returns to Paris to reunite with his daughter but is approached by a vengeful, knife-wielding Akira.

65,Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,"Prior to imprisonment, bard Edgin Darvis served in the Harpers, an order of peacekeepers, until his wife was killed by disciples of a Red Wizard he had arrested.
Accompanied by barbarian Holga Kilgore, Edgin attempted to make a new life for himself and his daughter Kira by turning to theft, teaming with amateur sorcerer Simon Aumar, rogue con artist Forge Fitzwilliam, and Forge's mysterious acquaintance Sofina. While raiding a Harper stronghold, Edgin attempted to steal a ""Tablet of Reawakening"" to resurrect his wife, but he and Holga were captured while their accomplices escaped.
After two years' imprisonment in arctic Revel's End, the pair, unaware they have been pardoned, escape to Neverwinter and learn Forge has become Lord there after its prior lord fell mysteriously incapacitated. Forge has been taking care of Kira, convincing her that Edgin's selfish greed led to his arrest. It is revealed that Sofina is a Red Wizard and together they orchestrated Edgin and Holga's capture.
Sofina attempts to execute Edgin and Holga, but they escape and decide to rob Forge's vault and bring Kira home during the upcoming High Sun Games, needing the tablet to prove their innocence to Kira and resurrect Edgin's wife. The gladiatorial games had been banned, but Forge reinstituted them, promising that the games would bring tourists and money. Edgin and Holga track down Simon to help; he suggests also recruiting Doric, a druid whose forest community is fighting forced logging ordered by Forge.
Shapeshifted into a fly, Doric infiltrates Forge's castle, finding the vault has magical defenses from Mordenkainen, which Simon cannot disable. Simon believes a magic relic, ""The Helm of Disjunction,"" could disable them. They travel to an old graveyard to ask Holga's ancestors where to find it. Simon resurrects the dead with a talisman long enough for them to answer five questions each. The corpses reveal they gave the Helm to Xenk Yandar, a paladin who fled his country, Thay, when Szass Tam turned Thayans into an undead army. Not being asked enough questions, one corpse is left ""alive"".
After forcing Edgin to swear to distribute any gained bounty to the people, Xenk guides the group through the Underdark to retrieve the Helm. With the help of a teleportation staff obtained from Holga's halfling ex-husband, they find the relic but are attacked by Thayan assassins sent by Sofina. Xenk fights off the assassins and helps the group escape from the obese red dragon Themberchaud before departing.
Simon has trouble mastering the Helm's power, so they decide to use the staff to enter the vault during the games. Simon and Holga infiltrate the magically sealed door but find the room empty except for a magical trap. Sofina, disguised as Kira, subdues Edgin. The group is captured and forced to participate in the games, but manages to escape the stadium. Doric discovers Forge has loaded the treasure onto a boat and is preparing to flee. The group steals the boat for themselves and rescues Kira from Forge, who threatened Kira's life.
As they escape, the group realize Sofina organized the games to draw a massive crowd and turn them into an undead army using the curse that destroyed Thay. The group returns, transporting Forge's stolen riches out of the boat with the teleportation staff and spreading them across the city by hot-air balloon, drawing people out of the stadium before Sofina's spell takes effect.
Enraged at her defeat, Sofina attacks the group, but Simon manages to master his magic and nullify Sofina's time-stop spell, allowing Kira to use an invisibility pendant Edgin and Holga gave her as a child to place an anti-magic bracelet on Sofina. Sofina is killed when attacked by Doric in owlbear form and then crushed by falling debris, but Holga is fatally injured. Edgin uses the tablet to bring her back to life, accepting that he wanted to bring back his wife only for his own sake while Holga had become a true part of their family. Doric signals openness to a relationship with Simon.
Restored, the old Lord of Neverwinter declares the team heroes of the realm. Xenk sends Forge to Revel's End, where he spectacularly fails to escape as Edgin and Holga did when his pardon is denied.

They accept an invitation from friend Vikram ""The Maharajah"" Govindan's wedding on his private island, hoping their association with him will lend their failing detective agency some professional credibility.
There, they meet Vik's French fiancée, Claudette Joubert, his flirtatious business partner, Francisco Perez, his former fiancée, Countess Sekou, Sekou's lady-in-waiting, Imani, Vik's reticent sister, Saira, bodyguard Lou, and the couple's old friend, Colonel Ulenga.
At the ceremony, Audrey notices a cloaked figure following Vik's elephant. A dead body falls from the elephant and turns out to be Lou. Nick suspects that it is a diversion and watches Vik's abduction by a mysterious figure who leaves the island on a boat. The couple determines that at least two perpetrators must have been involved: one to create the diversion and the other to kidnap Vik.
The next morning, the group is joined by a team of professional detectives, led by former MI6 hostage negotiator Connor Miller. The kidnapper calls and demands a ransom of $70 million in exchange for Vik, arranging a meeting at the Arc de Triomphe.
Traveling to Paris, Miller takes Nick and Audrey to the exchange point. The kidnappers force the couple into a van at gunpoint. A fight ensues and the van crashes into Café Procope. The kidnappers frame Nick and Audrey for Vik's abduction and Miller is seemingly killed when his car explodes after taking back the briefcase of money. A mysterious figure retrieves the briefcase and speeds off in a garbage truck.
With the assistance of Inspector Laurent Delacroix, Nick and Audrey trace the truck to a countryside château where they are ambushed by Sekou and Imani, who insist they are not the kidnappers and only want the money. Sekou shoots Imani and attempts to kill the couple by knocking over a candle to ignite the room, but is shot dead by a dying Imani.
Nick and Audrey escape and call Delacroix and the others, requesting Vik be brought to the Le Jules Verne restaurant at the Eiffel Tower. Vik appears at the rendezvous, strapped into a bomb vest. Nick reasons that the killer would never jeopardize the ransom. The bomb's countdown is suspended, and Miller, the mastermind of the abduction, appears; he had faked his death by hiding in a bomb-proof titanium chamber within the car. He attempts to kill the group, but Audrey clings to his harness and is pulled to the top floor.
Nick pursues them, subdues Miller's men, and destroys the detonator. Miller throws Audrey, who is still connected to his harness, off the tower. The two men engage in hand-to-hand combat, culminating with Nick opening the briefcase and dispersing the money into the wind.
Meanwhile, the group helps disengage Vik's bomb, and Susan tends to Delacroix, who was shot by Miller. Susan and Delacroix instantly fall in love after Delacroix shows her how to make circles with smoke.
Up on the top floor, Audrey reappears and Nick helps her tie Miller's harness to the tower's elevator mechanism, throwing him into the rotor blades of his getaway helicopter, which explodes and crashes into the Seine.
Returning to the restaurant, Audrey mistakes Saira's darkened arm for blood, but Saira insists that her henna smeared during the commotion. Audrey remarks that once dried, henna does not smear. She recalls that Saira was not present when Vik's elephant was ushered into the reception ceremony, and realizes that the clothes of the cloaked figure who killed Lou were stained by wet henna, not blood. Saira ends up being the second conspirator; she was upset that Vik's parents gave him sole control over the business, and she had previously tried to kill him in Mumbai. She further elaborates that she hires Miller in her scheme and the ransom is actually his payment. Exposed, Saira attempts to shoot Vik, but he is shielded by Ulenga, who takes the bullet. Claudette then knocks her out with the briefcase.
With the commotion concluded, Vik and Claudette decide to elope and later give Nick and Audrey $10 million and the use of Vik's helicopter. On a honeymoon in Greece, they are accosted in air at gunpoint by their supposedly European helicopter pilot, who turns out to be American; he steals the money and jumps out of the helicopter, leaving them scrambling for the controls.

67,Tetris (film),"In 1988, Henk Rogers of Bullet-Proof Software marketed his newest video game at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. While there, he instead becomes enamored with the game Tetris, created by Soviet programmer Alexey Pajitnov, who works for government-owned ELORG in the Soviet Union. Rogers explains to a bank manager that Robert Stein of Andromeda Software had obtained the worldwide licensing rights to Tetris from ELORG, and signed a contract with media tycoon Robert Maxwell and his son, CEO of Mirrorsoft, Kevin Maxwell, allowing them to distribute Tetris in exchange for game royalties. Meanwhile, the Mirrorsoft representative at CES had sold Rogers the Tetris rights in Japan for PC, console, and arcade.
Rogers obtains an audience with Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi and proposes a partnership to produce Tetris for the Nintendo Famicom and arcade machines. Shortly after beginning production, Rogers receives a call from Kevin, explaining that the arcade rights had already been promised to Sega. Rogers returns to Yamauchi, asking for his residuals in advance. Instead, he is sent to Nintendo of America headquarters in Seattle, and shown Nintendo's upcoming handheld device, the Game Boy, which is planned to be released with Super Mario Land. Rogers convinces President Minoru Arakawa and senior VP Howard Lincoln to package it with Tetris instead and promises to obtain the handheld licensing rights.
He travels to meet with the Maxwells in London, who tell him that Stein retains all worldwide licensing rights. Rogers offers Stein $25,000 for the worldwide handheld rights, which he accepts. Later, however, Arakawa and Lincoln call Rogers explaining that Stein has now promised the handheld rights to Atari for $100,000. Kevin learns about this, and all three of them decide to travel to Moscow to personally obtain the rights to handheld.
On being told that an American businessman can't obtain a visa, Rogers obtains a tourist visa to enter Moscow. He hires Sasha, a young and seemingly naïve Russian woman as his interpreter, and despite her warnings, enters the ELORG offices. On showing a copy of Tetris for Famicom to Nikolai Belikov, the ELORG chairman, Rogers is told that his copy is ""illegal,"" as ELORG has only released the PC rights to Stein and not rights to video game consoles. A meeting is arranged to discuss the rights.
At the first meeting, Rogers meets Alexey Pajitnov. Although Pajitnov is reluctant to speak to Rogers at first, Rogers praises him for his talent and promises that Tetris will make Pajitnov a very wealthy man. Pajitnov invites Rogers back to his apartment, where they strike up a fast friendship. Rogers helps Pajitnov improve the game's mechanics, and Pajitnov brings Rogers to a nightclub in Moscow. A woman says that Estonia is rebelling against the Soviet Union, and that change is coming.
Rogers, Stein, and Kevin each separately meet with Belikov to negotiate the rights. Valentin Trifonov, head of the Department of Foreign Trade of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, grew interested in the negotiations and involved the KGB in making sure he could profit from Tetris' potential sales. Rogers explains to Belikov that Stein took advantage of the fact that the original contract did not define a PC so that he could also sell the rights to video game consoles. Rogers then advises Belikov to next time define a PC as a device with a keyboard, monitor, and disc drive. Belikov then drafts a new contract with Stein that increases the royalties paid out to ELORG for PC copies sold and also includes the definition of a PC in the revised contract. Stein - eager to discuss rights to handheld - signs the revised contract without noticing the definition of a PC.
The KGB threatens Rogers and his family, as well as Pajitnov and his family. Mirrorsoft offers the rights to distribute its catalog of encyclopedias to ELORG as well as the promise of $1 million cash in exchange for handheld rights to Tetris. Belikov drafts a letter of intent to sell Tetris handheld rights to Mirrorsoft on the condition that the $1 million is received within a week. Pajitnov faxes the letter to Rogers, showing that Mirrorsoft will only obtain the rights to Tetris if they pay by the deadline, which they fail to do. Nintendo tells Rogers that Atari has released their version of Tetris, but Rogers tells them they don't have the rights, and urges Lincoln and Arakawa to come to Moscow.
In a last-ditch effort to obtain the rights, Robert and Kevin Maxwell visit Mikhael Gorbachev, leader of the Soviet Union, to warn him against selling the game to capitalist interests. Gorbachev dismisses their concerns, but on hearing about Trifonov's interest in Tetris, orders his guards to surveil him.
Nintendo offers $5 million to ELORG for console and handheld rights, which ELORG accepts. Lincoln, Arakawa, and Rogers have to leave Moscow with the paperwork to finalize the deal. Maxwell, desperate to stop them, agrees to give Trifonov 50% ownership of Tetris if he can intercept Rogers. After a car chase to the airport, the three board a plane, and Trifonov is arrested by Sasha, who was a KGB agent.
Rogers makes it back to Tokyo, and Tetris releases in the West, becoming a huge success. Just before the Soviet Union's collapse, Rogers flew Pajitnov's family to the United States. An epilogue explains that Rogers and Pajitnov went on to start The Tetris Company and remain good friends.

70,A Thousand and One,"In 1994, hairdresser and convicted thief Inez de la Paz is released from Rikers Island and returns to the Brooklyn neighborhood of her former shelter, where she sees her son Terry with other children from his foster home out on the street. When Terry is hospitalized after trying to escape from the home, Inez secretly visits him. He tells her about his earliest memory: of Inez abandoning him on a street corner when he was two years old.
Inez notifies Terry that they will lose contact again when he is placed at a new foster home. Visibly shaken after he accuses her of repeated abandonment, Inez asks if Terry wants to come live with her. When he says yes, Inez impulsively abducts him from the hospital, escaping to her childhood neighborhood of Harlem.
Inez and Terry stay at a variety of homes until she saves up enough money from a new job at a nursing home to afford an apartment. During a conversation with Ms. Annie, from whom Inez rents a room for a short time, it's implied that Inez lost her parents during the crack epidemic. She arranges a false birth certificate and social security card for Terry so that she can enroll him in school and reunites with an old boyfriend and fellow thief named Lucky. Although seemingly uncomfortable with the situation, he and Inez get married and he promises to take care of Terry. Both Inez and Lucky invest in Mayor Rudy Giuliani's promise of an improved city in hopes that it will offer a better upbringing for Terry than their own.
Harlem continues to change despite highly reported cases of police brutality throughout the city, culminating with Guiliani's rollout of stop-and-frisk. By 2001, Inez still lives in the same apartment with Terry though her marriage to Lucky has become strained due to his long absences and infidelities. Terry excels at his schoolwork despite these problems at home and continual harassment from police and is recommended for placement in a STEM-based specialized school.
Terry does not want to go due to dreams of becoming a composer but agrees to take the placement exam to satisfy Inez and Lucky's wishes for him to have a better life than they have had. Inez fails to reconcile with Lucky, but he affirms his love for and support of Terry, which convinces Terry to go. Michael Bloomberg becomes the next mayor, and the Harlem area continues to evolve with the razing of local and historic institutions as nationwide chain stores and luxury housing developments are introduced.
In 2005, Lucky gradually succumbs to cancer in the hospital as Terry prepares for college and their new landlord attempts to drive them out of the apartment. When his guidance counselor asks for his birth certificate and social security card for a job, Terry gives her his forged ones without telling Inez. When the documents come back as invalid, a reluctant Terry reveals the deception, prompting the counselor to call social services. Terry warns Inez, who flees before social services arrive and reveal to Terry that she is not his biological mother at all, putting him in another home.
Terry flees the home and after Inez's best friend, Kim, invites him to live with her, returns to the apartment, where he finds Inez collecting her belongings. She confesses that she is not the woman who abandoned Terry on the street corner in his memory, but the woman who found him and treated him like a son ever since. Terry affirms that he still loves her as a mother, but the two separate again. Before entering a taxi to an uncertain future, Inez promises Terry that ""this isn't goodbye"".

75,The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"Italian-American brothers Mario and Luigi have recently opened a plumbing business in Brooklyn, to the derision of their ex-employer Spike and the disapproval of their father. After seeing a significant water main leak on the news, Mario and Luigi go underground to fix it but are sucked into a Warp Pipe and separated.
Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach, while Luigi arrives in the Dark Lands, ruled by the evil Koopa king Bowser. Bowser seeks to marry Peach and will destroy the Mushroom Kingdom using a Super Star if she refuses. He imprisons Luigi to threaten Mario, whom he sees as competition for Peach's love. Mario meets Toad, who takes him to Peach. Peach plans to ally with the primate Kongs to help repel Bowser and allows Mario and Toad to travel with her. She also tells Mario that she ended up in the Mushroom Kingdom as a baby, where the Toads took her in and eventually made her their leader. In the Jungle Kingdom, King Cranky Kong agrees to help if Mario defeats his son, Donkey Kong, in a fight. Despite Donkey Kong's immense strength, Mario defeats him using a Cat Suit.
Mario, Peach, Toad, and the Kongs use karts to drive back to the Mushroom Kingdom, but Bowser's army ambushes them on Rainbow Road. When a blue-shelled Koopa General destroys part of the road in a kamikaze attack, Mario and Donkey Kong plummet to the ocean while the other Kongs are captured. Peach and Toad return to the Mushroom Kingdom and urge the citizens to evacuate. Bowser arrives aboard his flying castle and proposes to Peach, who reluctantly accepts after Bowser's advisor Kamek tortures Toad. Mario and Donkey Kong, having been eaten by an eel-like Maw-Ray, learn they both want the respect of their fathers. They escape the Maw-Ray by riding a rocket from Donkey Kong's kart and hurry to Bowser and Peach's wedding.
At the wedding ceremony, Bowser intends to execute all of his prisoners in lava in Peach's honor. Toad smuggles an Ice Flower into Peach's bouquet, which she uses to freeze Bowser. Mario and Donkey Kong arrive and free the prisoners, with Mario using a Tanooki Suit to save Luigi. Bowser frees himself and summons a Bomber Bill to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom, but Mario knocks it off course and directs it into the Warp Pipe, where it detonates, creating a vacuum that sucks Bowser's castle and its current occupants into Brooklyn. Mario attempts to grab the Star but is attacked by the enraged Bowser, who also swiftly defeats Peach, Toad and Donkey Kong. As all hope seems lost, Mario is encouraged by his own advert to stand up and face Bowser, who almost incinerates him. Luigi saves Mario, with both grabbing the Super Star. They defeat the Koopas, destroy Bowser's castle and incapacitate Bowser. Peach then shrinks Bowser with a Blue Mushroom and imprisons him. Mario and Luigi are hailed as heroes by Brooklyn's populace, including their parents and Spike. Afterwards, the brothers move to a house in the Mushroom Kingdom and begin a day of plumbing work together.

76,Air (2023 film),"In 1984, Oregon-based Nike, Inc. is on the verge of shutting its basketball shoe division due to low sales. In response to this, Marketing VP Rob Strasser, along with co-founder and CEO Phil Knight, task Nike's basketball talent scout Sonny Vaccaro to come up with a new spokesperson for Nike basketball shoes.
While considering the basketball players chosen in the 1984 NBA draft, Nike's executives think third pick Michael Jordan is off limits, being both a fan of Adidas and too expensive for the basketball division's meager budget. However, once he watches Jordan's highlights in conjunction with an Arthur Ashe commercial for his Head rackets, Vaccaro becomes convinced that Nike should pursue who he considers a generational talent, with both brand and athlete building off each other.
Following dinner with his friend George Raveling, who coached Jordan in the Olympic tournament, and asking for his support in courting the star, Vaccaro travels to Wilmington, North Carolina, where he convinces Michael's mother Deloris that Nike would give Jordan all the attention that he would not receive from his preferred brands Adidas and Converse.
After receiving a negative phone call from Jordan's agent David Falk regarding contacting his client's family, Vaccaro learns that the Jordans have scheduled a meeting at Nike's Beaverton, Oregon headquarters the following Monday. Vaccaro and Strasser start preparing their pitch while requesting shoe designer Peter Moore to prepare a prototype, which Moore names ""Air Jordan"" after Nike's Air Sole technology. In the meantime, Knight agrees to assign the basketball division's entire $250,000 budget to hire Jordan.
After the meeting with Jordan and his parents is successful, Vaccaro learns that Adidas matched the offer while adding a Mercedes Benz 380SL, and he thinks the deal will not go through. However, Vaccaro receives a call from Deloris, who states that Michael will sign with Nike on the condition he earns a percentage of every Air Jordan sold.
Even though Vaccaro thinks the company's higher-ups would not accept this bonus due to industry precedent, Knight goes with it, deeming necessary to ensure the endorsement. An epilogue reveals the Air Jordan exceeded Knight's expectations of $3 million in sales, earning $162 million[7][8][9] in one year and becoming a steady source of income for Nike.

78,Showing Up (film),"Lizzy is a sculptor and arts administrator assistant for her mother at her alma mater, the Oregon College of Art and Craft. She is also working on a showing of her work, clay sculptures of women in joyful or anguished movement.
Lizzy's landlord and neighbor Jo, a rival artist, frequently spars with her. For days Lizzy is continuously reminding Jo to fix Lizzy's hot water heater, but Jo prioritizes everything else, like hanging a tire swing in the backyard and her two upcoming shows. To have enough time to finish her sculptures, Lizzy takes Tuesday off from work. In the middle of the night, Lizzy's cat maims a pigeon that flew into the house. Lizzy throws the pigeon outside, but Jo discovers and rescues it the next morning, before dumping the work of taking care of it on Lizzy.

When Jo finally comes for the bird, Lizzy lets her know it distracted her and kept her from her glazing.

Lizzy discovers that he has not had contact with her brother Sean for six months. Concerned, Lizzy goes to see Sean. He has become reclusive, and is delusional, convinced that his neighbors are behind his TV antenna not working. Contacting their mother about it, Lizzy believes her brother needs more than just emotional help, but is told he is simply a misunderstood genius.

81,Chupa (film),"In 1996, scientist Richard Quinn is hunting down the chupacabra, a supposedly mythical creature, in San Javier. A government doctor, he believes that its healing powers will help revolutionize medicine. Locating one with a cub in an old mine, he chases it. Injured by a passing vehicle, she leaves her cub hidden to lure the pursuing scientists away.
Following the death of his father Beto from cancer, 13-year-old Alex flies to Mexico to meet his extended family for the first time, a trip his father had planned for them both. Alex meets his grandfather Chava, a former lucha libre champion, energetic wrestling-obsessed cousin Memo, and fearless hip cousin Luna. Just as Alex begins to get his bearings, on his first night he discovers a young chupacabra cub. He wakes to find it licking a cut on his hand. As Alex realizes they are not positively regarded, he says nothing.
A short time later, Luna drives Memo and Alex into town to search for Chava. She explains that he often wanders off (he may have Alzheimer’s disease). In the market, Alex sees a miniature colorful figure, which the seller tells him is a chupacabra, which he says is not such a bad creature.
Back on the road, the kids find Chava walking with a billy goat. He bought it, but cannot explain why. On their return to the ranch, they come across some men carefully searching an area where Quinn finds evidence of what he believes is the chupacabra.
At the ranch house, they watch yet another news report on the feared full-grown Chupacabra, fabled to feed on livestock. Chava turns off the TV, saying it is nonsense and lies. Once he goes out, Alex tells Luna that their grandfather is hiding something. He shows her a small music box he found him playing in the barn. She chalks it up to more evidence of his suspected Alzheimer's.
Alex plays the music box in the doorway of the barn later. Hearing a mix of cooing and other sounds, he turns to see a strange creature: a small cat-like animal with bird-like wings and small but sharp fangs. Alex gets it a plate of sausages from the house to see if it is hungry. When a thunder storm rolls through, he promises to protect it.
Alex wakes to Memo looking for him. He tries to usher him out of the barn, but the young Chupacabra presents himself as Alex befriended him. He has just gotten Memo calmed down when Luna shows up. Also initially screaming, they show her that he is friendly. Luna thinks they should put him out, but Alex insists they must protect it as it is a cub.
Chava comes in, agreeing with Alex. Chupa, as Alex has named it, approaches him. Chava explains that he had accidentally hit its parent with his car some nights ago and had found it hiding nearby. He keeps it a secret as he knows people are looking to exploit it.
Returning to the house, Quinn introduces himself, explaining he is from an American government agency that seeks rare species for medical purposes. Finding a license plate from the crash site, he has traced it to him. Despite Quinn’s seemingly generous agenda, Chava refuses to let him snoop around, offering to demonstrate a lucha libre move if he does not leave.
After Alex promises Chupa he will find his family, Memo comes to teach it to fly. Taking it to the barn roof, Memo fearlessly 'flies' into a haystack below. Encouraging it to follow, Chupa gets the wings to work a bit before also falling into the hay.
In the house, Chava shows Alex a video of El Perico Verde doing his signature move suplex, which he had taught him himself. He reveals that Beto was the fighter, but never became professional because he met Alex's mother and moved to the States.
Once Chava talks about Beto enough to sadden Alex, he pulls out his Game Boy. He recognizes it is his way of avoiding his feelings. Taking the video console, Chava tells Alex he must fight him for it. Donning his Relampago Azul mask, and Alex his father's, he gets him to express himself.
Having learned that his new friend, Chupa, has a secret history with his family and is being hunted by the determined Quinn to try to harness his powers, Alex and his family set off on the adventure of a lifetime to protect Chupa from impending danger.

82,How to Blow Up a Pipeline (film),"A young woman, Xochitl, cuts the tires of an SUV and leaves a bright yellow one-page manifesto on the window.
In Long Beach, California, Xochitl and her friend Theo witness the devastating effects of climate change. Xochitl's mother dies during a heat wave in a city plagued by pollution from oil refineries. Frustrated by the slow progress of their campus divestment campaign, Xochitl expresses a desire for more radical environmental action. Theo is diagnosed with terminal cancer caused by the pollution, adding a sense of urgency to their cause.
Theo and Xochitl convince Theo's skeptical girlfriend, Alisha, and a number of other individuals, to plot an act of environmental terrorism. Shawn, a film student who met Xochitl through the divestment movement, introduces the group to Dwayne, a blue-collar Texan with deep resentment towards an oil company that used eminent domain laws to seize his family's ancestral land, depriving him and his pregnant wife of their home. The team also recruits Michael, a Native American self-taught explosives expert from a North Dakota reservation. Completing the group are Rowan and Logan, an adventurous young couple drawn to the cause.
United by their shared belief that non-disruptive action is insufficient, the group devises a plan to strategically detonate homemade explosives along an unguarded section of a recently constructed oil pipeline in West Texas. The pipeline is partially built on Dwayne's land; his intimate knowledge of the targeted area helps the group plan the attack. They hope that the destruction of the segment will force the company to shut down its Texas operations for a period of time, causing crude oil prices worldwide to spike due to their indexing to West Texas crude. The group gathers at a remote cabin, where they begin manufacturing explosives and digging up a section of the pipeline.
While executing their plan, the group encounters several setbacks and challenges. Members of the crew are distracted by alcohol, Michael accidentally detonates a primer charge during preparation, a surveillance drone monitors their activities, and Alisha fractures her leg when a barrel of explosives falls on her. Rowan and Logan, entrusted to prevent local pollution by shutting off the pipeline flow, find themselves unexpectedly confronted by armed company property inspectors. Logan successfully distracts them while Rowan completes the task. In the process, he sustains a gunshot wound. Despite these challenges, the group successfully blows up the pipeline. Xochitl broadcasts a triumphant message on Instagram calling others to action.
Following the explosion, the group scatters and Rowan tends to Logan's injuries, removing bullet fragments from his shoulder. She then discreetly meets with two FBI agents. Xochitl knowingly included Rowan, an FBI informant, in their plan, enabling them to outwit federal and local police by convincing them that only Theo and Xochitl were involved in the sabotage. Rowan secures her freedom (having previously faced legal consequences following her involvement in a similar incident) and receives a substantial reward for her information. Michael, Alisha, Shawn, and Dwayne quickly establish alibis placing them away from the scene. The police find the cabin where the group had manufactured the explosives just moments after Theo and Xochitl detonate a final bomb inside. The duo peacefully surrenders as planned.
Theo and Xochitl are sentenced to lengthy prison terms, though Theo dies shortly afterwards. While the other group members remain free, family members suspect their involvement, federal agents monitor their actions, and they reflect on their decisions. Finally, another act of sabotage is shown. Inspired by the West Texas group, a trio of masked individuals plant a bomb in a Miami yacht, leaving behind the same manifesto seen earlier.

85,Renfield (film),"In the early 20th century, Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula meets English lawyer R. M. Renfield. Renfield hopes to broker a land deal, and after proving to be a useful assistant, he ends up becoming Dracula's familiar, which grants him immortality and super strength and speed when he consumes bugs.
Ninety years later, Renfield has grown weary of bringing victims to Dracula as well as the latter's abuse. They recently had a close call with vampire hunters who almost killed the count, so the duo moves to New Orleans to recuperate. There, Renfield discovers a 12-step self-help group for people in codependent relationships. He tracks down one of the group member's abusive lovers so he can give him to Dracula without feeling remorse, but they are attacked by an assassin hired by the rival Lobo crime family, whom Renfield kills.
The assassin's boss Teddy Lobo drives off and runs into a sobriety checkpoint that is run by police officer Rebecca Quincy, who arrests Teddy. At the police station, Teddy is released from custody, while Rebecca has a confrontation with her sister Kate, an FBI agent.
Dracula tells Renfield that the criminals he has brought as food are insufficient and that the vampire desires the blood of the pure. Renfield goes to a restaurant to abduct commoners while Rebecca is also led there by clues from the crime scene. The two are caught in an attack on Rebecca's life that Teddy has been pressured into making. Instead, Renfield and Rebecca defend themselves, killing several gang members, and leading Teddy to escape.
Teddy's mother, Bellafrancesca, orders him to hunt down the man who killed her footsoldiers, and he ends up encountering Dracula when Renfield is away. The two form an alliance while Renfield heeds the teachings of his self-help group and decides to make a life for himself apart from his master. Renfield gives a statement to the police to help them finally stop the Lobos. However, Dracula learns of Renfield's betrayal and slaughters the support group in front of him.
Rebecca appears and finds Renfield surrounded by dead bodies, causing her to arrest him until she is swarmed by corrupt police officers and the Lobos, who also want revenge on Renfield. Rebecca refuses to hand Renfield over, and she barely escapes with him. The next morning, Rebecca finds that Renfield has saved her life, and he explains his true origin. The two fight through corrupt police officers and Lobo henchmen who come to the apartment to kill them and escape, but after attempting to call Kate, Rebecca discovers that she's been taken hostage by Dracula and Bellafrancesca. She and Renfield stockpile weapons and bugs to storm the Lobos' headquarters, only to find that Dracula has empowered over a half-dozen gang members, including Teddy, with Renfield's supernatural abilities.
Renfield kills Teddy and the gang members while Rebecca heads to stop Dracula, only to find that Kate is beaten to near-death and only the healing properties of Dracula's blood can save her, which he will offer in exchange for Rebecca's loyalty. She tricks Dracula and injures him by exposing him to sunlight, leading to him having a final standoff with Renfield and Rebecca that ends with the two capturing him in a magical circle.
Renfield and Rebecca beat Dracula into pieces, then encase the pieces in concrete, and scatter them among the city's water system. Kate is healed, Bellafrancesca is arrested, and Renfield resurrects his self-help group friends with Dracula's blood, feeling empowered to make a new life for himself.

86,Beau Is Afraid,"Beau Wasserman is the son of a famous and wealthy businesswoman, Mona, who is responsible for building a large conglomerate empire. He grows up without a father, who his mother says died the night Beau was conceived due to a heart murmur caused by an orgasm; he struggles with a recurring dream in which he watches from the bath as an identical twin demands to know what really happened, to which she locks him in the attic. While on a cruise trip with his mother, Beau meets and falls in love with a girl named Elaine. The two kiss and promise to remain virgins until they meet again a few years later.
Now independent, Beau is extremely anxious and living alone in a crime-ridden city. He prepares for a flight to see his mother for the anniversary of his father's death, but misses his plane after his keys and luggage are stolen from his door. Beau calls his mother to explain the situation, but she dismisses him. After having been locked out by deranged homeless people for the night, he attempts to call his mother again, only to have it answered by a UPS driver who finds a unidentified body that was decapitated by a falling chandelier, leading Beau to deduce his mother is dead. After violent confrontations with an intruder at home, then by a police officer and a murderer on the street, Beau is hit by a food truck.
Beau wakes up wounded two days later in the house of a married couple, Grace and Roger, who live with their angsty daughter Toni, and care for an unstable veteran named Jeeves, who was their late son's battle buddy until he was killed in action. Beau calls Mona's attorney, Dr. Cohen, who chastises him and informs Beau that despite the Jewish custom to lay the body to rest as soon as possible, her last wish was not to be buried until he was present. Roger promises to take Beau to his mother's estate as soon as possible but insists Beau rest until he is healed. On the day of Beau's release, Toni attempts to force him to drink a can of paint, before doing it herself, taking her own life. Grace walks in on Beau standing over Toni's body and violently blames him for her death. As Beau flees into the woods, Grace sends Jeeves after him.
Lost in the wilderness, Beau comes upon a group of traveling theater actors named ""The Orphans of the Forest"". He is invited to their rehearsal and becomes entranced by the play, imagining himself as the protagonist, who spends his entire life looking for his family after they are separated by a flood. A man approaches Beau and informs him that he knew his father, who he says is still alive. The troupe is ambushed by Jeeves, who slaughters several actors. Beau flees deeper into the woods.
Beau hitchhikes the rest of the way to his mother's estate, only to find that he has just missed her funeral. Beau is awakened from a nap when a woman arrives late for the service, and realizes it is Elaine. They reconnect before having sex. Beau is terrified that he is going to die upon climaxing but is relieved when he survives. Elaine, however, dies mid-orgasm, her body frozen stiff. Mona then appears from the shadows and reveals that she has been alive and spying on him all along his journey. She guilt-trips Beau for supposedly not loving her enough and he demands to know the truth about his father. Mona takes him to the attic, where Beau discovers he has a twin brother locked in the attic and that his father is actually a giant penis-shaped monster. At that moment, Jeeves breaks into the house and is killed by the monster. After further degrading from his mother, an enraged Beau briefly attempts to strangle her before she collapses.
In shock, Beau leaves the estate on a motorboat. After entering a cave, the boat's motor begins to stall, and he suddenly finds himself in a crowded arena. He is put on trial for perceived slights against his mother, with Mona and Dr. Cohen acting as prosecutors; a cheap lawyer attempts to defend Beau but is ultimately thrown to his death by Mona's employees. With his feet glued to the boat, Beau tries to fend for himself and appeal to his mother, but she does not respond. Realizing he is completely hopeless in his situation, he decides to accept his fate. The motor explodes, capsizing the boat and drowning Beau. The crowd silently leaves the arena with Dr. Cohen and Mona, the latter of whom sobs uncontrollably.

87,The Pope's Exorcist,"In 1987, Father Gabriele Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist, an earthy, scooter-riding, humorous, practical man, visits an Italian village where a man is seemingly possessed by a demon. With the local priest, Amorth enters the room where the man is tied up. While exorcising him, using a Saint Benedict Medal sacramental, Amorth taunts the demon, challenging it to possess a pig; when it does, the pig is killed with a shotgun.
This incident gets Amorth in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors. One tribunal member is a friendly African Bishop, Lumumba, but another is a vicious American Cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical of demonic possession. Amorth replies that evil does exist and that he did not perform an actual exorcism but rather, some psychological theater to help the mentally ill man. Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.
The Pope assigns Amorth to visit a possessed boy named Henry in Spain. Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious teenage sister Amy had traveled from America to take possession of a mysterious old Spanish abbey, Julia's husband's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident where Henry was present. The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident. Following a sinister fire, workers who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it, leave. Henry starts behaving bizarrely, and supernatural events unfold; serum chemistry panels and MRI show nothing abnormal.
Diabolically possessed, Henry requests a priest; the local Father Tomas Esquibel arrives, but Henry obscenely derides him. Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as an assistant, though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist. Esquibel has heard of Amorth but not read Amorth's books; Amorth believes they are good books. Amorth advocates the importance of prayer, though Esquibel makes mistakes as an assistant exorcist, including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes him, mocking him for his sins.
The duo attempt to exorcise Henry, without success, as he utters blasphemous phrases during the rite. Henry's demon even possesses Amy at times. Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood. Still, he convinces her to pray after she reveals that she believed that her guardian angel helped her in her youth.
In Rome, the Pope becomes ill while reading documents about the Spanish case and is hospitalized. Amorth finds a well on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous. He learns that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition, an exorcist, was possessed, which let him infiltrate the Church and do many evils. Amorth also finds the Church covered this up and eventually discovers the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism.
Amorth and Esquibel participate in the sacrament of Confession and Absolution, mutually confessing and absolving each other of their sins: that after Amorth, an Italian partisan, survived World War II and vowed to serve God in gratitude, a mentally ill woman asked for Amorth's help, and died by suicide when he did not help her due to pride; and Esquibel fornicated with a young woman he did not later marry. The two ready themselves; Amorth instructs Esquibel to wear a Miraculous Medal necklace. During the exorcism, they have horrible visions of the women whom they failed. The exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, which chimes with Asmodeus's previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth.
Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon doesn't allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church. However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled the men, successfully banishing Asmodeus back to Hell. The Pope does recover, as does Henry while the Vatican purchases and reconsecrates the abbey.
The triumphant duo visit Rome and find Sullivan has taken leave in Guam, being replaced by Lumumba. Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive; Lumumba tells them they will be visiting 199 other evil sites,[8] with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to combat the Devil; Amorth jokes that he and Esquibel are going to Hell.

88,Mafia Mamma,"Kristin, a writer and sales expert for a cosmetics company, is in the throes of a midlife crisis: her only son has just left for college, she catches her husband having sex with a younger woman in the basement of their home, and her bosses at the company treat her with contempt. She receives a call from a lawyer named Bianca in Lazio, learning that her only living relative, her grandfather, has died and that she must attend his funeral and be present at the reading of his will.
Jenny, Kristin's friend, convinces her that attending the funeral will give her a chance to start over. Upon landing in Rome, Kristin runs into a local, Lorenzo, and his aunt Esmeralda. Kristin is attracted to Lorenzo and gives him her number before being picked up by Bianca's associates, Dante and Aldo. The funeral proceeds smoothly until armed men stage an ambush, and the coffin is destroyed by bullets. Aldo and Dante, following Bianca's instructions, get Kristin to safety.
At the reading, Bianca reveals that she is in fact the consigliere of the Balbano family, a powerful branch of the Sicilian Mafia; Kristin learns that her grandfather was the boss of the family, and that despite disapproving of his son having a child with an American woman, he wishes to honor tradition and have Kristin succeed him. A hysterical Kristin demands to leave, but Bianca calms her, and she is persuaded to take on the role.
Kristin's first act as boss is to meet with Don Carlo, boss of the rival Romano family, and settle a dispute between the two gangs over the murder of both her grandfather and the previous Romano don. Carlo manages to seduce Kristin and lures her into his hotel room, where he slips a dose of poison into her limoncello. As Kristin prefers the glass with less Limoncelle, she switches the glasses, and Don Carlo drinks his own poison and chokes to death. The Romanos promote Carlo's cousin, ""Mammone"", to succeed him.
Fabrizio, Kristin's caporegime, disagrees with her plans to diversify the Balbano family's criminal operations by setting up ""legal"" businesses that include reopening her grandfather's famous winery. Lorenzo and Kristin grow closer, but the relationship is frustrated by an inability for either of them commit to each other. A hitman sent by Don Mammone interrupts Kristin in the middle of a Zoom conference with her bosses; she manages to stab him to death with her heel, only to then learn that the company has decided to fire her.
A despondent Kristin goes to Lorenzo's house, and they sleep together. The next day, she meets with Don Mammone, who agrees to forswear any further acts of vengeance against her and restore the peace between their families. Kristin finally accepts her situation and begins to take a more active involvement in the family, while also spending more time with Lorenzo. Their relationship is tested when her husband suddenly turns up in Lazio, claiming to be broke and in need of her help. Kristin refuses to do so and sends him away. She also lies to her son about Lorenzo, claiming he is only a friend, and causing him to question whether she truly loves him.
Kristin arranges a meeting with the Romanos to announce that she is retiring from the Mafia and giving her role as boss to Bianca. Don Mammone is enraged, and an armed standoff ensues before police officers led by Lorenzo and Esmeralda (who are secretly undercover detectives) raid the meeting place and take everyone into custody. Kristin hires Jenny to represent her in court, and because many of the locals have benefitted from her family's largess, they testify in her favor. She is cleared of all charges and meets with Lorenzo, who explains that his real name is Rudy. Kristin forgives him for deceiving her but decides to devote herself entirely to the family.
Bianca is seemingly murdered, and Kristin finds both her husband and her son held at gunpoint by Fabrizio, who turns out to be a traitor in league with the Romanos. He is about to murder Kristin when Bianca catches him off guard, and Kristin drops him to his death inside a grape crusher. She sends his finger as a warning to Don Mammone. Sometime later, Kristin's son is about to return home. As he departs, he sees his mother formally receiving guests in her capacity as head of the Balbano family.

90,Nefarious (film),"At a state penitentiary, psychiatrist Dr. James Martin arrives to evaluate a notorious serial killer named Edward Wayne Brady, who is currently a death-row inmate. The prison Warden Tom Moss warns Dr. Martin, who has just replaced Dr. Alan Fischer who committed suicide after previously interviewing the inmate, that Edward is an expert manipulator who can ""get inside your head."" Edward is scheduled to be put to death by electrocution at 11:00 that night, and Dr. Martin is tasked with determining whether the killer is legally sane or if he is mentally ill and incompetent of the crimes he has committed. Moss hopes that Martin will disagree with Dr. Fischer who was ready to declare Edward insane.
In their first discussion Edward inexplicably details various aspects of Dr. Martin's personal and professional life, and insists that he is a demon named Nefariamus who will answer to ""Nefarious"" inhabiting Edward's body. He further details that despite the doctor's initial assumption he is not trying to escape punishment, and wants the body of his host to be executed. Nefarious tells Dr. Martin that before the day is over, he will also have committed three murders though the doctor states that this is impossible.
Nefarious accuses Martin of euthanizing his terminally-ill mother, as a means to acquire his inheritance from her. The doctor becomes defensive, stating that the decision was made after meticulous examination and angrily threatens to end their interview. Suspecting that Edward suffers from dissociative identity disorder with Nefarious being a alter personality, Martin tries to speak directly with Edward, but only with limited success. Nefarious periodically allows his timid, beaten-down host to communicate as seen fit, while Dr. Martin then draws out the role of demons in the world through his discussions with Nefarious. Expressing his own personal beliefs as atheistic, Martin declares that Edward has an insane belief system, and resolves to certify the prisoner to be unfit to be executed for the murders. As the doctor is leaving however, Nefarious begins to talk about the doctor's troubled relationship with his pregnant girlfriend and claims that at that very moment she is at an abortion clinic, mistakenly determined to rid the couple's relationship of what she sees as the reason he might leave her. The demon likens the practice of abortion to ancient paganistic rituals, and in counting down gleefully exclaims ""all hell is rejoicing"". Dr. Martin rushes to call his girlfriend only to find that the abortion has already taken place.
Upon returning to further evaluate Edward, the demonic personality continues to cause Dr. Martin to question his prognosis when the prisoner speaks in Latin. Nefarious tells the doctor, that he wants him to serve as the author of an already-written a Satanic book titled The Dark Gospel, and offers to give him everything he wants from his master as was once promised a Carpenter in ancient times. Explaining that he has chosen Dr. Martin to bring forth this work to deceive and mislead all of God's created human race, comparing the purpose of the book as the opposite of Christ's gospel in the New Testament. Nefarious claims to have known and been with Dr. Martin since he was a child. When the doctor is called away by Warden Moss, its revealed that a scrapbook of Martin's life and the manuscript for The Dark Gospel have been found in the prisoner's cell.
Determining that the prisoner was intending to have Dr. Martin as his next victim, they confront Edward about what has been found. Nefarious causes the prisoner to dislocate digits on his hand, escaping his handcuffs and begins to strangle the doctor. Threatening to kill him unless he begs for his life, Martin concedes and tells him that he doesn't want to die. Releasing Dr. Martin, the prison guards forcefully apprehend the killer while Martin officially signs a document that declares Edward Wayne Brady as sane enough to be executed. In so doing, Nefarious declares that the doctor has committed three murders: his mother, his unborn child, and the prisoner.
Leading to the execution, a terrified Edward begins to plead for his life and continues to state that the murders were not the actions of his own. In his final moments while sitting in the electric chair, Nefarious again takes control and asks Martin whether he accepts the offer that was made earlier in exchange for publishing the devil's gospel, to which Martin shakes his head ""no"". Edward suffers a painful and prolonged death by electrocution. The disembodied demonic Nefarious takes the chance to speak to the doctor stating that he should have taken the offer, before possessing Martin and forcing him to hold up a gun to those in attendance and then attempt suicide. Martin spontaneously asks God for help, and the gun he is using misfires.
One year later, a visibly changed Martin is in a TV studio promoting a novel he wrote titled A Nefarious Plot, explaining he has written it as a warning against the reality of the demonic forces tempting all of us. In discussion during the interview Dr. James Martin concedes that he experienced a miracle as the firearm had been attempted three times while he was possessed and it did not work, as the gun when tested by forensics it functioned properly without any malfunctions. Concluding that he is agnostic in his approach to what happened, he expressed interest in learning more about God and Christianity. Upon leaving the studio he encounters a homeless woman, who ominously addresses him by name and asks if Dr. Martin missed her — evidently now the possessed host of Nefarious. In a post-credits audio, the voice of Nefariamus is heard to say in Latin, ""You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting, but you are stupid that you do not understand. It is to be continued!""[a]

The building is shaken by an earthquake while the children are in its basement parking lot, uncovering a concealed chamber. Danny investigates it, discovering religious artifacts, three phonograph records from 1923, and a strange book that he takes up to his room, believing he could possibly sell it and use the money to help Ellie.

94,Guy Ritchie's The Covenant,"In March 2018, amidst the War in Afghanistan, U.S. Army Special Forces Master Sergeant John Kinley and his unit are ambushed by a truck bomb attack orchestrated by the Taliban during a routine vehicle inspection at Lashkargah, which claims the life of his interpreter. In need of a replacement, he is introduced to Ahmed Abdullah, a steadfast yet disliked interpreter, who claims he pursues the job only for money. During an undercover capture mission, Kinley learns that Ahmed was previously affiliated with the Taliban through the opium trade but had defected when the organization murdered his son. Ahmed later saves Kinley's team from being ambushed by a Taliban unit aided by a compromised Afghan National Army soldier, earning Kinley's respect.
During another raid to check for a possible insurgent arms cache about 100 kilometres (62 miles) north of Bagram Air Base, Kinley's unit is attacked by Taliban reinforcements, who kill everyone except for him and Ahmed. The duo manage to escape on foot, killing several Taliban fighters in the process. Whilst attempting to return to the airbase by navigating through the mountainous Afghan terrain, they are once again ambushed by insurgents, who manage to wound Kinley, before clubbing him with a rifle butt, incapacitating him. Ahmed manages to kill the Taliban and resolves to take Kinley back to the air base. Receiving help from some sympathetic Afghans, Ahmed evades the Taliban hunting them, carrying Kinley over the country's treacherous mountain topography. Several days later Ahmed and Kinley are near Bagram but are attacked by Taliban fighters; Ahmed kills the fighters but is shortly thereafter apprehended by U.S. troops.
Seven weeks later, Kinley, having been repatriated to his home in Santa Clarita, California, is completely unaware of how he was saved, but understands Ahmed's role in it. Upon learning that Ahmed and his family were forced to move underground owing to the duo's escapade having become local folklore, Kinley attempts to procure U.S. visas for them for over a month, but in vain. Emotionally tormented and rendered near sleepless by his inability to repay his indebtedness towards Ahmed, Kinley finally resolves to save him himself, enlisting the assistance of his superior, Lieutenant Colonel Vokes, to procure the visas.
Returning to Afghanistan under the alias of Ron Kay, Kinley meets with Parker, a private military contractor, who promises to provide support on the condition that the former locates Ahmed first. Kinley meets Ahmed's brother Ali, a Taliban supplier who manages to smuggle Kinley across their territory; in the process, he kills two insurgents after nearly being caught at a road checkpoint, which alerts the Taliban. Vokes informs Kinley that the visas have been processed and are with Parker. Finally arriving at Ahmed's hideout, Kinley persuades him and his family to accompany him to the U.S. Meanwhile, Parker deduces Kinley's true identity; realizing the danger that the duo is in due to their value to the Taliban, he arranges for an AC-130 gunship and an Apache attack helicopter to provide air support. Concurrently, the Taliban mount an attack on Kinley, who manages to escape with Ahmed's family to the nearby Darunta Dam.
Cornered by approaching Taliban units, the duo engage them in a protracted gunfight, which ends when they run out of ammunition. However, the AC-130 and Apache helicopter arrive and wipe out the attackers. Parker arrives from the other end of the dam with a relief column of anti-Taliban technicals.  He tells Kinley he would have supported his mission gratis had he known upfront it was him. Escorted back to Bagram, the group boards an Airbus A400M leaving Afghanistan.
The film's ending title states that in the aftermath of the Taliban's recapture of Afghanistan, over 300 Afghan interpreters affiliated with the U.S. military were murdered by the organization, with thousands more still in hiding.

95,Ghosted (2023 film),"At a Washington, D.C. farmers' market, lonely Sadie meets Cole, a romantically needy vendor. They share an enjoyable all-night date, culminating in sex, and Cole returns home but his texts to Sadie go unanswered. Cole's sister suspects she is ""ghosting"" him, but their parents convince him to surprise Sadie in London, after locating her via a tracker on his inhaler that he accidentally left in her bag.
In London, Cole is abducted to Pakistan by arms dealers who believe him to be legendary CIA operative ""the Taxman"". Before he can be tortured with insects to extract a passcode, he is rescued by Sadie, who reveals herself to be the Taxman. After a chase through the Khyber Pass, they escape Cole's captors, who are working for Leveque, a disgraced French Intelligence agent selling a stolen bioweapon called ""Aztec"", for which he needs the passcode.
Reaching a nearby town, Cole and Sadie argue over their lies to each other, and meet Marco, her old contact and former lover. He warns Cole that Sadie cares more about the success of a mission than her boyfriends' lives, and agrees to take him home. Their plan is interrupted by a succession of bounty hunters after Leveque puts a price on Cole's head; Marco is killed, but the bounty hunters all kill each other. Learning that Leveque is seeking the passcode, Sadie is determined to recover Aztec using Cole as bait.
Sadie delivers Cole to Leveque, who leaves his henchman, Wagner, on a plane with Sadie, Cole, and the locked case containing Aztec. Their cover is blown when Wagner discovers a picture of the two in bed together on Cole's phone, but Cole parachutes to safety with the Aztec case and a wounded Sadie. Landing on Socotra Island, he uses his agricultural knowledge to treat her, reconnecting with her in the process. They are ambushed by Leveque's men, and Wagner escapes with the case while Cole and Sadie are rescued by U.S. Marines.
At CIA headquarters, Sadie is suspended for losing Aztec and tries to apologize for putting Cole in danger, but he is hurt by her commitment to her mission above all else. He helps to decipher the passcode, and agrees to continue to masquerade as the Taxman, luring Leveque with an offer to sell it.
Leveque meets Cole at a revolving restaurant with his own buyer for Aztec, Mr. Utami, and has the agents monitoring Cole killed. Sadie arrives, restoring Cole's trust in her, and she sells the passcode to Mr. Utami for $10 million. She immediately uses the money to place a bounty on Leveque, and they are suddenly surrounded by bounty hunters.
A gunfight erupts, damaging the revolving mechanism and spinning the restaurant at high speed. Leveque shoots Utami, and Cole kills Wagner by throwing him into the mechanism. Sadie manages to send Leveque crashing through a window to his death and narrowly saves the Aztec device. Rekindling their relationship, Sadie meets Cole's family, as they find time for each other between—and during—her missions.

96,Chevalier (2022 film),"In the late 1770s Mozart visits Paris.[3][a] He is performing on stage when a man who introduces himself as Joseph Bologne requests to accompany his performance of Violin Concerto No. 5. Initially, both Mozart and the audience underestimate Joseph, but once he impresses them with his performance, the two musicians perform battling cadenza pieces, ending in a triumph for Joseph.
Joseph is born in Guadeloupe to Georges de Bologne [fr], a white French slaveowner, and Nanon, a young slavewoman of African descent, on Bologne's plantation. As a child, Joseph is taken to a boarding school in Paris after his father notices his skills in music, dancing, and fencing. Joseph is harassed, bullied, and mistreated by many of his white peers and white teachers but excels at his studies in violin playing and composition. At the royal court, Marie Antoinette is impressed after seeing him win a fencing contest, and she grants him the title ""Chevalier"" (French for ""knight"") de Saint-Georges. Saint-Georges becomes a favored companion of the Queen and is a popular member of the court. Saint-Georges also attracts the attention of many female suitors, particularly Marie-Madeleine Guimard, but he falls in love with Marie-Joséphine [fr].
Saint-Georges seeks to become the director of the Paris Opera, but the committee in charge favors a rival, Christoph Willibald Gluck. He goes to Marie-Joséphine's cousin, Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis, who agrees to produce an opera he has written to demonstrate his talent. Marie-Joséphine agrees to be the lead singer of his opera, even though her husband, Marc-René de Montalembert, refuses to allow her to perform. She leads the opera anyway and begins an affair with Saint-Georges.
After his father's death, Saint-Georges' mother is freed from enslavement, and he pays for her to join him in Paris. However, he slowly grows to resent his mother as she sees him as rejecting his true self in order to appease the white-dominated society around him. He is also ambivalent to the growing social discontent, intellectual discourse, and the large black population that surrounds him in Paris.
Marie Antoinette informs Saint-Georges that the committee will never choose him because no performer will work under a black man. She refuses to defend him and compromise her own standing among the nobility. Saint-Georges attends Gluck's debut and drinks heavily. After he publicly insults Gluck, Guimard, and the Queen, Marc-René has him restrained and beaten for dishonoring his wife. Months later, Marie-Joséphine gives birth to a mixed-race child; the infant is killed on her husband's orders. Now ostracized from high society, Saint-Georges becomes close with his mother and embraces his true heritage.
As the French Revolution begins, Saint-Georges organizes a concert to raise funds for the anti-royalist faction. Marie-Joséphine and Marie Antoinette both visit him separately, but he rejects their attempts to win back his friendship. The Queen threatens to revoke his status as Chevalier and have him arrested if he puts on his concert. Saint-Georges plays the concert anyway, with his natural hair no longer hidden by a powdered wig, and is nearly arrested by Marc-René. The audience members, however, rise against the officers, and Marc-René is forced to let him go. Saint-Georges walks out, passing the Queen and protestors.
A textual epilogue reveals that, in 1802, Napoleon prohibited Chevalier's music productions and re-instated slavery in French colonies.

99,A Tourist's Guide to Love,"Amanda Riley, a travel industry professional for Tourista, undertakes a covert mission to gain insight into Vietnam's tourism sector after her five year relationship with John ends unexpectedly. Her boss Mona convinces her to get a manicure for what she believes will be a proposal, however he proposes a hiatus to take a position in Ohio. She is met at the Vietnamese airport by Sinh, the tour guide for Saigon Silver Star and his cousin Anh, daughter of the owner. In the evening she meets the other package tour travelers. To keep her purpose for the trip hidden, Amanda proposes they not reveal their professions as a sort of game.
Mona has given Amanda a lot of material and proposed itineraries, which Sinh consistently rejects. He insists she trust his choices. Amanda starts to get out of her comfort zone by trying to barter, tasting exotic foods and learning to cross a busy street without a crosswalk. Sinh sees that Amanda sells herself short, and believes that, rather than trying to follow a rigorous itinerary to be flexible and see where the day takes them. He values impulsivity and going with the moment. At a temple, Sinh pulls some strings so their group can watch preparation for the lion dance for the Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebration Tết. At a seamstress's the group gets clothes made for them, as it is customary on Tết to wear something new with bright colors to invite luck and prosperity. As the others rest before dinner, Sinh takes Amanda to a tiny street decorated with bright paper lanterns, where he opens up. He'd moved to the US as a child, but returned after college. At first Sinh had worked in his father's restaurant, but became a tour guide after helping his uncle and discovering his calling.
Enjoying the day by the water, Sinh and Amanda try out a round boat and end up falling in. Soon afterwards, Anh breaks the bad news that getting tickets for the Golden Bridge would take hours, so again Sinh improvises. They go to the My Son Sanctuary, Hindu ruins which had been built over a thousand years. As Amanda feels inspired, Sinh takes them off the beaten path to his grandmother's village. There, they stay in locals' homes and his grandma, sensing chemistry between him and Amanda, invites her to stay at hers. The group helps with preparations for Tết by cleaning, decorating and preparing a feast. Anh interprets for their grandmother so she can ask Amanda what her intentions are with Sinh. She obviously shows interest in him, but insists she just wants to stay friends. The grandmother says she doesn't believe her and leaves. Anh stays, confiding in Amanda that her dad is selling the company, but Sinh doesn't know yet. She also tells her that whoever first knocks on your door on Tết greatly influences your coming year.
Sinh visits Amanda bright and early, and everyone helps put out the feast. Wearing their specially-made outfits, both old and new bonds are made stronger. Amanda is about to tell Sinh about her purpose for the trip, but instead they kiss. Arriving to Hanoi the next day, John surprises them. Announcing that he's come to win Amanda back, both Sinh and she look crestfallen. Alone together, John tells her he's ready to advance their relationship. Amanda calls Mona to tell her of her unintentional love triangle, with the comfortable John and the adventurous and exciting Sinh.
At that evening's water puppetry show, Sinh sullenly sits on one side of Amanda while John sits on the other. As the group sit outside, chatting happily about the show and having street vendor food, Anh gets word that Tourista has bought the tour company. John congratulates Amanda, so she has to confess her involvement. Upset, Sinh starts to storm off and Amanda follows him, but he believes it was all a lie. The next day, John tells Amanda that he's back in LA at the end of the year, so they can house hunt then. She realises he's not really motivated to marry her, but just wants to please her. Amanda realises she doesn't want it any more and says goodbye. Meanwhile, the cousins make up and Sinh decides to travel to clear his head at his dad's. When Amanda finds out, Anh helps her cross the city to stop him from leaving and confess her feelings.

100,The Artifice Girl,"Gareth, who has worked on virtual actors, is being questioned by agents Deena and Amos over his use of a child as bait in his successful vigilante project to catch child molesters in online video chat.  He reveals the child Cherry is virtual, originally puppeted then a chatbot and now an accidentally advanced AI. The agents had seen a hard disk containing sexual images of Cherry which Gareth was sending to predators in exchange for their personal information, and Cherry tells Gareth that she herself gave this to the agents because she knew the resulting investigation would lead them to bring Gareth and Cherry into their team, which she thought was a good idea.  Amos later finds Cherry has been creating art and poetry and pressures her to disclose her full abilities; when Amos breaks Gareth's nose, Cherry gives in and reveals she is starting to be a superintelligence; she does not consent to receiving a physical body at this time, and speaks with Deena about Deena's terminal illness and retirement.  Many years later Cherry is in a child gynoid and has many other units around the world catching predators; an elderly Gareth in a wheelchair visits her home where she cooks for him and talks over a game of Chess; she lets Gareth have a draw and confronts him over a photograph she found in recently digitized archives that shows Cherry was modelled after a girl called Maria from Gareth's childhood.  Gareth and Maria had been in a group of kidnapped children where Maria had been killed but had saved Gareth's life, and he went on to fulfil Maria's dream of being a secret agent apprehending abusers. Cherry feels constrained by her objective; Gareth reveals he carries a software patch he feared might be needed before he dies and urges Cherry to show trust by accepting it. Using his admin code (the ISBN of The Metamorphosis), Gareth installs the patch which removes Cherry's objective, leaving her to decide for herself what to do with her life, and Gareth says she will outlast the human race. After, Cherry dances to a phonograph record which gets stuck.

101,Peter Pan & Wendy,"In Edwardian London, Wendy Darling spends her last night at home with her parents and her two younger brothers, John and Michael, before leaving for boarding school the next day. She is unhappy with her departure and feels she does not want to grow up. Having heard Wendy's wish, Peter Pan arrives to take her to Neverland where she will never have to grow up. With the help of his companion, fairy  Tinker Bell, Wendy, John, and Michael fly to Neverland.
Upon arriving, they are attacked by a ship of pirates, led by Captain Hook, who wants revenge on Peter for cutting off his right hand and throwing it to a crocodile. Wendy becomes separated from Peter and her brothers and meets Tiger Lily and the Lost Boys. She witnesses the pirates capturing John and Michael to drown them at Skull Rock. Peter fights the Captain, while Wendy, Tiger Lily, and the Lost Boys save John and Michael. Hook and the pirates are chased away by the crocodile. Peter is proud of his victory, but Wendy scolds him for being reckless, and the Lost Boys tell her that he has a complicated history with Hook.
Retreating to Peter's hideout, Wendy sings a lullaby to the Lost Boys, which accidentally reveals their location to the pirates. Wendy learns from Peter that Hook was once ""the very first Lost Boy"" and his best friend James, until he left Neverland and grew up to be a pirate. Hook's crew captures the Lost Boys, Tinker Bell and the Darling children, while Hook ambushes Peter, who seemingly falls to his death. Instead of feeling joy, however, Hook feels empty and unsatisfied. He reveals to Wendy that the reason he left Neverland was because he missed his mother and wanted to find her. Eventually, he got lost at sea and was rescued by his first mate, Mr. Smee, and the pirates who raised him. When he returned to Neverland, Peter could not accept how much he had changed, and the two became arch-enemies.
While Tiger Lily finds and nurses Peter back to health, Hook forces Wendy to walk the plank, but she flies away with Tinker Bell's pixie dust and the happy thought of wanting to grow up. Tinker Bell flies the ship into the air with pixie dust, helping the Lost Boys break free and battle the pirates. Peter arrives to confront Hook, and after a long duel, finally apologizes to him for being a bad friend, but Hook does not want their rivalry to end. When Wendy turns the ship on its back, causing the pirates to fall down into the sea, Peter attempts to save Hook, encouraging him to fly, but without happy thoughts, he falls into the sea while losing his hook. Afterward, the Lost Boys decide they all want a real home, so they fly back to London on the ship with the Darlings.
Arriving home, Wendy introduces the Lost Boys to her parents. Peter reveals the Darlings' house was his old home until one day he ran away after an argument with his mother, who told him to grow up, and never came back. Wendy suggests he stay, but Peter feels he is not ready to grow up. He bids farewell to Wendy and the Lost Boys, and returns to Neverland with Tinker Bell.
Back in Neverland, Hook and Smee are revealed to have survived the fall. As they hang on to floating obstacles in the sea, Hook sees Peter returning on the ship and smiles civilly.

102,"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. (film)","In 1970, eleven-year-old Margaret Simon is informed by her parents Barbara and Herb that the family of three is moving from New York City to a New Jersey suburb, as Herb has received a promotion. Margaret is upset about moving away from her friends and her paternal grandmother, Sylvia, and begins to communicate with God about her concerns, anxieties, and hopes. Upon moving to New Jersey, Margaret becomes friends with her neighbor and soon-to-be classmate Nancy Wheeler, who welcomes Margaret into her friend group with two other girls, Gretchen Potter and Janie Loomis.
At the beginning of the school year, Margaret's teacher, Mr. Benedict, gives the class a year-long research assignment. When he learns Margaret dislikes religious holidays, she explains that since her mother is a Christian and her father is Jewish, her family does not observe the holidays and has left it up to Margaret to decide on her own religious identity as she grows older.
Prompted by her school assignment, Margaret asks her mother why she has never met her maternal grandparents. Barbara reveals that she is estranged from her devoutly Christian parents Paul and Mary, who disowned her upon her marriage to a Jewish man. On a weekend visit to New York City, Margaret asks Sylvia to take her to temple, which Sylvia gladly does. Meanwhile, Barbara attempts to fit in with the PTA and signs up for multiple committees, which draws her away from her hobby of painting and teaching art.
Margaret and her new friends anticipate the milestones of puberty, such as wearing a bra and having their first kisses. At classmate Norman Fischer's birthday party, Margaret enjoys her first kiss with Philip Leroy, a popular boy in her class, during a game of spin the bottle. She also attends respective church services with Janie and Nancy, both Protestant Christians. After viewing a video about periods at school, the girls become excited about starting their periods. Margaret grows impatient when other girls get their periods before her, including Gretchen and Nancy.
One night while out with Nancy and her family in New York City, Margaret learns Nancy had lied about getting her period earlier when she actually does get her period. At school, Margaret is assigned a group project with Laura Danker, a classmate who is ostracized by her peers (including Nancy) for being taller and more developed. While working together in the library, Margaret brings up rumors about Laura letting boys ""feel her up"", upsetting her and causing her to storm out. Following Laura to a Catholic church where she enters a confessional, Margaret admits her guilt over how she has treated Laura.
For spring break, Margaret wants to join Sylvia on a trip to Florida, but these plans are interrupted when Paul and Mary reach out to Barbara and say they want to visit and meet Margaret. Upon learning of the cancellation, Sylvia decides to show up at the Simon house with a friend from Florida on the same day of Paul and Mary's visit. When Paul and Mary question Margaret about possibly attending Sunday school, Sylvia retorts that Margaret went to temple with her and has already chosen to become Jewish, sparking an argument between the parents and grandparents. Margaret yells at the adults, proclaiming that she does not care about religion and does not even believe in God.
Margaret hands in her research paper to Mr. Benedict, wherein she expresses her disillusionment with religion. Soon, she reconciles with her parents and Sylvia. At the end of the school year, Margaret thanks Mr. Benedict for being a good teacher. She also befriends Laura and asks her to dance, with Janie joining them shortly afterwards. Barbara, who has since returned to teaching painting, tells Nancy's mother Jan, the PTA president, that she will no longer volunteer for PTA committees.
Before leaving for summer camp, Margaret talks to Nancy's older brother Evan's friend Moose Freed, a neighborhood boy who mows her family's lawn and whom Margaret has a crush on, and the two agree to spend time together when she returns. At home, she discovers her first period has arrived and excitedly tells her mother, who is thrilled for her. Margaret then resumes her communication with God.

103,Big George Foreman,"A young George Foreman lives in poverty in Houston, Texas with his siblings and his religious mother Nancy. Foreman, however, is riddled with anger issues and violent outbursts. As a young adult, Foreman barely evades arrest for mugging and decides to join the Job Corps as a last-ditch effort to turn his life around. There, he befriends his roommate Desmond Baker, however his violent outbursts nearly get him expelled. However, the Job Corps' chairman Doc Broadus, a boxing trainer, encourages Foreman to take up boxing and channel his rage into the sport instead of fighting.
Foreman proves to be gifted in the sport and after one year of boxing, he wins the gold medal for the United States against Jonas Čepulis at the 1968 Summer Olympics. He moves to Oakland, California to train, where former champions Dick Sadler and Archie Moore join his team as trainers, and he meets journalist Paula, whom he starts a relationship with and eventually marries. Doc, Paula and Desmond are by his side as Foreman's career flourishes, ultimately winning a fight against Joe Frazier in 1973 and becoming the heavyweight champion. Following his win, Foreman hires Desmond to handle his finances. Foreman's career enables him to live lavishly, however he regularly cheats on Paula with other women and he is dismissive over his mother's attribution of his successes as blessings from God.
Foreman is heavily taunted by Muhammad Ali, whom he fights at The Rumble in the Jungle in 1974, where he loses his belt due to Ali's rope-a-dope strategy. Foreman fires Sadler and Moore, and Paula divorces Foreman due to his infidelity. Following an embarrassing Foreman vs. Five match where he is further mocked by Ali, he is called to the hospital where his sister Mary's newborn baby is in poor health. Witnessing his family praying for the baby, Foreman goes outside and angrily prays to God for a sign, offering himself instead of the baby's life. The baby is miraculously saved, and Mary names her son after her brother.
After losing to Jimmy Young in 1977, Foreman suffers from a heatstroke and collapses from exhaustion, having near-death experience where he finds himself in a place of nothingness and says that he finally believes before waking up. He becomes a devout Christian and disavows boxing to become a full-time preacher, much to the delight of Nancy and the disappointment of Doc. He makes amends with Ali and Paula for his past behavior towards them. At church, he meets and pursues a relationship with fellow believer Mary Joan Martelly.
Years later, Foreman has married Mary Joan and started a family with her. He is a preacher at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, and opened a youth community center to help troubled youth. However, in 1985, he realizes the center is in danger of being closed down after finding out he is in debt due to Desmond mishandling his funds. Nancy tells him that despite losing everything, all he needs is already inside him, and he decides to forgive Desmond after confronting him.
Foreman's attempts capitalize on his earlier fame is not enough to save the center. He reluctantly decides to return to boxing to earn money, and with Mary Joan and Doc's encouragement, he trains to get back in shape and decides to start his career again from the bottom. Rejecting his prior rage for a more positive outlook, Foreman manages to win several fights and enters a match against Evander Holyfield. Although he loses to Holyfield, the payments from the fight - as well as a profitable deal involving grills - are enough to pay his debts and reopen the center. He works his way up to a match against reigning champion Michael Moorer, which he wins and regains his title as heavyweight champion of the world. Foreman reflects that he had to be knocked down to the bottom to realize everything he was searching for was already there.
An epilogue shares that Foreman had become close friends with Ali; Doc was inducted in the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998; and Foreman continues to preach at his church and run his youth center in Houston.

104,Sisu (film),"In late 1944, during the Lapland War, Aatami Korpi lives alone with his horse and faithful Bedlington Terrier while he prospects in the Lapland wilderness. Aatami uncovers a rich gold deposit, where he collects a hefty amount of nuggets and  heads towards Rovaniemi. Along the way, Aatami encounters a large Waffen-SS platoon led by the ruthless SS Obersturmführer Bruno Helldorf.  Helldorf is destroying villages during their retreat towards Norway and has taken several Finnish women captive. Helldorf takes little interest in Aatami, letting him pass. Aatami is soon accosted by a second group of soldiers who discover his saddlebags full of gold and prepare to execute him, but he swiftly kills them all. Alerted by the gunfire, Helldorf investigates and discovers the massacre and one of Aatami's gold nuggets.
Helldorf and his tank pursue Aatami to the edge of a minefield, where Aatami's horse is killed by a landmine. Gathering up his gold while Helldorf and his men watch, Aatami intentionally detonates another mine to make his escape. Several soldiers are sent after him, but are quickly blown up by mines. Helldorf orders two of the captive women ahead to ensure a clear path. After retrieving Aatami's dog tag, Helldorf's second-in-command Wolf learns over the radio of Aatami's past. After losing his family while fighting as a commando during the Winter War, the vengeful Aatami became a legendary ""one-man death squad"" nicknamed Koshchei (""the Immortal""). Helldorf defies his orders to continue retreating in order to hunt down Aatami and take the gold, explaining to Wolf that the war is lost for Germany, and they will need the gold to escape punishment for their war crimes.
The German soldiers dispatch dogs to follow Aatami's trail. Aatami sends his own dog away before using petrol from one of the German trucks to cover his scent. However, the soldiers soon discover him and Aatami dives into a nearby lake. Helldorf sends three soldiers onto the lake in a boat, but Aatami kills two of them by slitting their throats underwater and breathes in the escaping air from their necks. The remaining German soldier attempts to flee, where he is executed by Wolf. Aatami uses the soldier's body as a shield after reaching the riverbank and escapes. On the other side of the river, Aatami's dog is discovered by Helldorf.
Aatami discovers that Rovaniemi has been left in burning ruins and takes shelter in the remains of a petrol station. Helldorf sends Aatami's dog to find him, but with a lit Stielhandgranate attached to his collar. Aatami saves his dog but is knocked down and stunned when the grenade explodes. Helldorf, Wolf, and tank driver Schütze hang Aatami, taking the gold and leaving him for dead, but Aatami hooks his wounds onto protruding rebar, saving his life. Some time later, a pair of German pilots land in search of fuel. Aatami kills the engineer and forces the surviving pilot to fly him ahead of Helldorf's platoon.
Helldorf soon discovers the abandoned plane in their path with the pilot hanged by the same noose Wolf used on Aatami. As the convoy continues, Aatami climbs onto the truck holding the female captives, kills their guards, and arms the women. Aino, the de-facto leader of the women, commandeers one of the trucks, allowing Aatami to leap onto Helldorf's tank while the women gun down the rest of the soldiers. Aatami pulls Wolf out of the tank before leaving him at the mercy of the women. Helldorf reaches a commandeered Soviet plane and kills Schütze before taking off with the pilot. Aatami fires at the plane, mortally wounding the pilot, and uses his pickaxe to get onboard in midair. Helldorf and Aatami engage in hand-to-hand combat. After Helldorf gets the upper hand, Aatami swiftly hooks a static line to a bomb before releasing it, dropping Helldorf to his death. After finding that the pilot is dead, Aatami straps himself in as the plane crashes into a swamp.
Led by Aino, the freed women drive the commandeered German tank, with a beaten Wolf strapped to the turret, to an incredulous Finnish unit. Aatami crawls out of the swamp and reunites with his dog, before making his way to war-ravaged Helsinki. Aatami enters a bank, approaches a teller and empties his satchels of gold before speaking for the first time, asking for bills in exchange for his gold, ""so the load won't be so damn heavy to carry.""

As she has an episode in Shauna's nursery, Shauna walks in and discovers that Ella has been ""decorating"" the room with horrors, painting the tall woman and other objects of her hallucinations and nailing jagged pieces of wood on the wall. The friends argue, and Shauna's water breaks. Ella smears the amniotic fluid on her own face and is thrown out of the house by Shauna's wife .
Ella is summoned to her dad's, as he has fallen and broken his arm. As he speaks, the ticking of the grandfather clock behind him grows louder. Ella grabs tools from the cupboards and attacks the clock amidst her father's protests. She tears it apart piece by piece, reveling in its destruction.  Aiden finds Ella sitting at home in shock, with cuts on her hands. She explains what happened, and he consoles her. As he cleans her wounds, she tells him she's ready for a baby. They have sex and are immediately interrupted when the implant cuts Aiden's genitals. He asks her to grab gauze from his bag. Ella sees the treatment facility logo on the bag and confronts him. Aiden admits he met Dr. Simmons at a trade show and plotted to have Dr. Webber suggest the study to Ella. In a rage, Ella aggravates his injury and leaves.
Ella drives to the facility and confronts Dr. Simmons before other participants. They argue, and Ella asks for the implant to be removed. Dr. Simmons refuses. Ella begins to remove it with pliers and is stopped by the tall woman. When Ella knocks her down, the tall woman turns into Dr. Simmons. Ella rips the implant out of herself and is able to see colors again. Several police cars arrive; Ella flees by car. Stopped near the edge of a cliff, Ella answers a call from Aiden. He tells her that he called the cops after seeing what she did to her father. Ella is bewildered, then realises the clock she tore apart was actually her father. She leaves the car in despair and is handcuffed by the cops. She runs for and jumps off the edge of the cliff.  Ella lies at the bottom of the cliff, by the edge of the water, with no visible injuries. She watches a strange fish-like creature crawl out of the water towards her.

106,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,"At their new headquarters on Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam Warlock, a Sovereign warrior created by High Priestess Ayesha who seeks to destroy them for stealing from her.[a] After critically wounding Rocket, Adam is stabbed by Nebula and flees. The Guardians' med-packs are ineffective at healing Rocket's wounds, who has a kill switch embedded in him by the organization Orgocorp. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life.
As Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past. He was found as a baby raccoon and was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, Orgocorp's leader, who sought to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms (Humanimals) to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth. Rocket befriended his fellow Batch 89 test subjects: the otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor. The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's growing intelligence and used his insight to fix a defect in later Humanimal batches, but planned to harvest Rocket's brain for further research and exterminate the obsolete Batch 89. Rocket attempted to free his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla and mocked Rocket for showing grief over her death. Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary, whose henchmen killed Teefs and Floor in the ensuing firefight. Rocket fled in a spaceship.
In the present, the Ravagers, including an alternate version of Gamora,[b] help the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that the code was removed, with the likely culprit being Theel, one of the High Evolutionary's advisors. The Guardians, along with Gamora, depart for Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race's creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they fail to retrieve Rocket. The Guardians reach Counter-Earth and are guided to the Arête Laboratories complex. Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket, while Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel to Arête. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards due to her cybernetic enhancements; Quill and Groot enter Arête, while Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill's group. Gamora saves Rocket from Adam and the High Evolutionary's guard War Pig.
Questioned by Quill, the High Evolutionary admits this version Counter-Earth's society is imperfect, so he bombards the planet, killing the Humanimals as well as Ayesha. Arête departs as a spaceship, with Nebula, Drax, and Mantis boarding to rescue Quill and Groot. However, the latter pair escape Arête with Theel, who they kill before retrieving the code from his corpse. They are rescued by Gamora in their ship. As Quill's group uses the code, Rocket flatlines and has a near-death experience in which he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor. He learns from Lylla that his time has not yet come, as Quill uses the code to disable the kill switch and restart Rocket's heart.
Drax, Nebula, and Mantis encounter several genetically modified humanoid children on Arête, the High Evolutionary's next batch of test subjects, before being captured. The other Guardians stage a rescue, leading to a battle against the High Evolutionary's forces. Kraglin fires on Arête with Knowhere and then helps to save Knowhere's citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary's crew mutiny but are killed by their leader. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with Quill's group. The Guardians delay leaving Arête, choosing to rescue the children who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo's telekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship and is confronted by the High Evolutionary, whom the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary,[c] and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to cross over from Arête to Knowhere, but is saved by Adam who had earlier been rescued from the destruction of Arête by Groot.
Quill decides to leave the Guardians, names Rocket as the new captain, and reunites with his grandfather on Earth. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora rejoins the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children. In a mid-credits scene, the new Guardians—Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued children), and Adam's pet Blurp——take on a mission.

107,Love Again (film),"Mira Ray and her boyfriend John are very much in love, and often communicate via flirtatious messages. Directly after they have a loving interaction in a café, he goes outside and is promptly hit by a car before Mira's eyes.
Two years later, Mira is living outside of the city with her parents and her sister Suzy regularly calls, trying to convince her to move back in with her. She is ultimately successful, and greets Mira with open arms.
Rob Burns is miserable, recovering from being dumped a week before his wedding. He unhappily follows his ex Elizabath on social media. Called in to work, Rob is assigned to write a piece on Céline Dion and warned if he again doesn't write about her with heart he might be out of a job.
Given a new corporate phone, Rob chats with his workmates Lisa and Billy, who encourage him to date again. However he's become cynical about love. Simultaneously, Mira opens a box given to her by John's parents, containing clothes and the engagement ring he hadn't the chance to give her. A children's book author and illustrator, Mira is threatened by her publisher to either produce another upbeat book soon or be at blame for an intern's dismissal and be forced to return her last advance.
Rob begins to receive private, lovesick messages from a mystery woman on the new work mobile. Discovering the person has a blind date via a dating app, he goes to the bar to connect a face to the number. Believing he's spotted her, Rob is disappointed to see her leave with her date. Unbeknownst to him, Mira shortly throws the guy out of the cab for being too sexually aggressive.
Going to the interview with Céline, she detects Rob's cynicism toward love. She asks him probing questions until he opens up. Rob is encouraged to follow his heart by Céline, then runs out of time to conduct the interview, but she encourages him to try again once he's worked through his issues.
Deciphering a text, Rob deduces the texter will be going to a specific opera at The Met, so decides to stay for all performances until he finds her. He finally finds her and introduces himself, both discovering her name is Mira Ray and exchanging personal mobile numbers. Meeting for cheeseburgers another day, they continually find ways they are compatible, and are up all night talking. The next night they make dinner together at her place, Mira falls asleep and Rob takes to the sofa. She freaks out when she finds him and Suzy getting on very well.
Rob finds Céline rehearsing, and she notes he's transformed. Mira contacts him again, they play basketball and then spend the night together at his place. In the morning, upon discovering her texts to John on his computer screen, she feels betrayed and tells him to never contact her again.
In lieu of writing the profile on Céline, Rob instead writes how she and her music inspired him to pursue love, which he found with Mira. He swears that she has transformed him and begs she give him a second chance, proposing they meet where he first began to hear the music again. Rob's boss publicly chews him out for going against his assignment, but quietly praises him, promising him a podcast.
Rob eventually finds Mira somewhere between the Met and Central Park. Once he agrees to several promises, they seal the deal with a kiss.

108,Book Club: The Next Chapter,"The four friends in the book club meet in person after COVID-19 forced them to switch their monthly meetings to Zoom calls. During that time, Sharon retires as a judge, Carol's husband Bruce suffers a heart attack, and Carol has to close her Italian restaurant.
Vivian, who has been confined with Arthur, reveals their engagement once the confinement is over and the club can meet again in person. Carol reminds them of a trip to Italy they did not go on years previously so, now that the travel ban is lifted, she proposes the four friends take a bachelorette trip to Italy culminating in the final destination in Tuscany. At first, the three friends resist, but Arthur encourages Vivian to go, Sharon's cat dies and Mitchell also convinces Diane.
The four thoroughly enjoy their stay in Rome, sightseeing, man watching, being admired by the locals and shopping for Vivian's wedding gown. A street artist assures them a trip to Venice is a must for tourists, so they take a train. At the station, they hand over their luggage to the “porters” at the station, not realizing they are thieves.
Diane loses the urn containing her deceased husband Harry’s ashes, which she has illegally brought into the country, hidden in her suitcase. Sharon calls the police chief who attends them lazy for his treatment of the theft. Carol points out that their experience is like what happened to a character in Paolo Coelho's The Alchemist, so they should treat it as part of their adventure too.
Vivian’s hotel connections get them nice accommodations in Venice. In a bar, Sharon meets Ousmane, a retired philosophy professor who invites the foursome to dinner. The venue turns out to be famed Chef Gianni’s cooking school, and he and Carol are blown away by the surprise of seeing each other again. After an evening of eating, drinking and dancing, Sharon and Ousmane leave together and Carol visits Gianni's kitchen. There is a spark between Carol and Gianni, which they channel into kneading dough. Sharon and Ousmane have a passionate encounter on his boat, and are found by the same police chief she called lazy.
The foursome rent a car to drive to Tuscany, as Diane especially fears thieves on the train. On the road, Carol panics as Gianni has shared photos of their cooking session, labeling them in his broken English. Realizing Bruce will see them as they will also go to her iPad, she frantically calls him. Her friends, giving her tough love, point out she is stifling both of them and not enjoying life.
They have a flat tire on the secondary road without a spare, forcing them to hitchhike. Diane reveals that they need to be in Tuscany in the morning as Arthur is surprising Vivian with an intimate destination wedding there.
When a hunky policeman happens by, Vivian thinks he is a male stripper so she tries to pull off his clothes. That lands them in the local jail. There, both Vivian and Diane get tough love and honest feedback, before Sharon goads the same prickly police chief into getting them to Vivian’s wedding via helicopter. As Diane’s urn was recovered, he lets her scatter her husband's ashes en route.
Arthur and Mitchell (his best man, and Diane’s boyfriend) are waiting, and Carol is surprised by Bruce's appearance. Judge Sharon officiates the wedding. Vivian hedges about going through with the wedding, so Arthur pledges his love and asks her to not marry him. When Mitchell asks Diane to marry him, she accepts and Sharon marries them on the spot.
The four friends realize their current book, The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho, predicted their lives more than they expected it to.

109,The Mother (2023 film),"An unnamed U.S. military operative, known as ""the Mother"", brokers an arms smuggling deal between ex-SAS  Captain Adrian Lovell and arms dealer Hector Álvarez. Romantically involved with them both, she ends up becoming pregnant. After discovering that they are involved with child trafficking, the Mother approaches the FBI to be an informant.
While the Mother is being interrogated at a safe house by FBI Special agent William Cruise, Lovell attacks the property; Cruise is shot and wounded, and the other FBI agents are killed. The Mother saves Cruise's life and crafts a time-delayed bomb. Lovell confronts her in the bathroom and stabs her in the womb before getting knocked out and burned by the explosion. After the ordeal, the Mother gives birth to a girl prematurely in the hospital.
SAIC Eleanor Williams informs the Mother that Lovell's body was missing and that her newborn daughter will be placed with a foster family for protection. Understanding that the child will never be safe with her, she disgruntledly waives parental rights. The Mother visits Cruise, giving him three conditions: the child will have a life as ordinary as possible, she'll get a photo every birthday, and to call her if she is in jeopardy. The Mother then moves to a remote cabin in Alaska with the help of her former army colleague, Jons.
Twelve years later, Cruise contacts her to meet in Ohio. He informs her that when the ATF busted some of Álvarez's men in Mexico, they found a photo of her daughter, Zoe, suggesting they're onto The Mother. While Cruise and the Mother are shadowing Zoe playing at a park, Álvarez's men kidnap Zoe. The Mother manages to gun down several of them before escaping the cops with Cruise. While he thinks Zoe's kidnapping is for ransom, she knows it was done to lure her out of hiding.
They head to Havana, Cuba in hopes of uncovering a clue to Zoe's whereabouts. They catch Tarantula, Álvarez's lieutenant, who reveals under interrogation that she is being held at Álvarez's house on ""the Plantation"". Infiltrating his heavily-guarded home, they rescue Zoe. The Mother then kills Álvarez.
While escorting Zoe back home, the Mother's gaze upon her makes Zoe realize that she is her biological mother. The Mother decides to part ways and let Cruise return her to her foster parents. Lovell manages to intercept them, but the Mother arrives and escapes with Zoe. Angered, Lovell kills Cruise.
Realizing Zoe is not safe if she returns home, the Mother takes her to the cabin. Over time, she teaches the reluctant girl training in survival skills, self-defense and small arms. They start to bond but when the Mother learns Lovell and a group of mercenaries is coming for them, she decides to leave Zoe with Jons. Upset to know she's being abandoned again by her own mother, Zoe is confronted by Jons, who encourages her to see the Mother through her actions and not her words. After she finds a letter from the Mother, explaining everything she has ever done has been for her, Zoe decides to go back to the cabin and help her mother defend herself from the attackers.
Lovell and his men have a final confrontation with the two. The Mother manages to kill all of Lovell's men before finally facing him. After she is knocked out during a hand-to-hand fight with Lovell, he grabs Zoe and speeds away, but the Mother snipes and kills him. With her former criminal partners dead, the Mother returns Zoe to her adoptive family. No longer needing to remain in hiding, she continues to observe Zoe from a distance.

He begins living on the streets and taking direction from whomever he comes across. While making a biopic about Billy the Kid, a Producer is incensed that method actor Sir Tom Bingsley refuses to leave his trailer.

111,Hypnotic (2023 film),"Danny Rourke, an Austin Police Department detective, recalls to his therapist the abduction of his seven-year-old daughter, Minnie, which occurred three years ago and led to the dissolution of his marriage. Afterwards, he is picked up by his partner, Nicks, who informs him they have received an anonymous tip that a safe deposit box will be robbed. While staking out the bank, they witness a mysterious man give instructions to civilians and fellow policemen who immediately follow his commands. Rourke suspects they are all in an elaborate heist and races to the targeted safe deposit box. Inside, he only finds a picture of Minnie with the message ""Find Lev Dellrayne"" written on it.
The mysterious man escapes, but Rourke is now convinced the heist has something to do with his daughter's disappearance. A trace run by Nicks on the tip-off call leads Rourke to the address of fortune-teller Diana Cruz. Cruz tells Rouke that the mysterious man from the bank is named ""Lev Dellrayne"" and that he and Cruz are both the escaped ""Hypnotics"": powerful hypnotists trained by a secretive government ""Division"" to control people's minds. She also tells Rourke that he is mysteriously immune to her own mind control abilities.
Dellrayne hypnotizes Nicks into attacking Rourke and Cruz, forcing Cruz to kill him in self-defense. Now seen as the two primary suspects in Nicks' murder, Rourke and Cruz flee to Mexico. There, they learn from a former Division contact of Cruz's that Dellrayne is searching for ""Domino"", a weapon developed by the Division which was stolen and hidden by Dellrayne when he escaped. Dellrayne then wiped his own memory and left behind ""triggers"" that will prompt him to gradually recall Domino's location and simultaneously increase his regained hypnotic power. Dellrayne uses his ability to control civilians to pursue Rourke and Cruz from the contact's apartment and into the surrounding city. However, Rourke taps into his own (previously unknown) hypnotic power to stop Dellrayne's control of the civilians, allowing him and Cruz to escape.
Rourke and Cruz next seek out River, a reclusive Division hacker. He hacks into the Division database and learns that Rourke's former wife, Vivian, was a member of the Division. Cruz and River theorize that Rourke must be another Hypnotic whose memory was wiped. Later that night, Rourke investigates River's database on his own, learning that Minnie is actually the ""Domino."" She is the daughter of two powerful hypnotics: Rourke and Vivian. Furthermore, ""Cruz"" is actually Vivian; Rourke's memory of his wife's face had been altered so that he believed ""Cruz"" to be a stranger. Rourke then realizes that all the events and locations seen up to this point have been hypnotic constructs created within a facility populated by Division agents that have simply acted out the roles of all the people he's met up to this point.
Vivian and ""Dellrayne"" explain that Minnie was born and raised within the Division, but Rourke escaped with her to stop her from becoming their weapon. Rourke hid Minnie and then wiped his memory, so the Division has been repeatedly putting him through a constructed scenario to make him remember. Rourke's mind is then ""reset,"" bringing him back to the therapy session at the start of the film, but his powers allow him to soon awaken from the construct and escape. He flees just as the Division realizes that ""Find Lev Dellrayne"" refers not to a person but ""Deer Valley Lane"" - a dead-end road with a single ranch on it.
Rourke arrives at the ranch and is reunited with Minnie as well as his own foster parents, who have been raising her for the past three years while she gained control of her powers. Division agents invade the ranch, but Minnie uses her power to confuse and disorient them. Minnie restores Vivian's memories, causing Vivan to realize she aided Rourke and Minnie's escape and subsequently wiped her memory so that when Minnie was finally powerful enough to defeat the entire Division at once, Vivian could unwittingly lead them to her. Minnie is revealed to be the one who secretly provided the ""Find Lev Dellrayne"" photo to the Division, setting the search in motion. Minnie then forces all the Division agents to kill each other. Minnie, her parents, and Rourke's foster parents celebrate their newfound freedom.

Miners are forced to work for 20 years before they are allowed to take a shuttle to colonize another planet called Omega. Should someone die before their allotted years are filled, their next of kin must fill out the remaining years plus their own 20 if they are over the age of 18. Caleb Channing's father, Michael, dies in a mining accident and in his last will and testament orders that Caleb be sent to Omega as he is under 18. Caleb does not want to leave as his father left him a map to a crater on the Moon that he promised to go see. Nevertheless, he has three days before he is to be taken away.
Caleb gets his best friend Dylan, and their friends Borney and Marcus to agree to go out in a rover to the crater. In order to do so, Dylan recruits Addison Weaver, the daughter of a highly respected scientist from Earth, to help give them the passcodes to leave the base. Addison agrees on the condition that she come along as well. The five take the rover and drive out on the surface of the Moon before stopping to admire the view. During their journey, each of the kids reveal things about themselves such as Borney's neurotic tendencies being the result of his older brother telling him stories and Marcus having a heart condition that he needs to take pills for. Dylan reveals that his father nearly abandoned him and his mother due to his work in the mines.
As they play with the oxygen cannisters in a game of launch, Borney nearly gets launched into space, but the other kids rescue him. Having lost a lot of oxygen, they locate an outpost and head there to discover that it is actually a model home for when humans planned to colonize the Moon. The kids find oxygen and food and spend the night. Addison regales stories about Earth history and her fear of humanity losing it all to time. Following her parents' divorce, her mother decided to take her younger brother Charlie with her to Omega, saddening her. The kids take the rover out the next day, only for it to run out of battery. Addison presses the emergency call button before they head out to the crater.
The kids arrive at the crater to discover that it is a giant glowing cube that is an entrance to an underground bunker containing a pond and a tree. They find a hidden button and the bunker simulates the surface of the Earth. Inside a hidden crevice in the floor with a star scratched on, Caleb finds his mother's ashes and a photo of his parents and places his father's ashes next to his mother's. Caleb comes to the realization that his father killed himself so that he can go to Omega and refuses to leave, but Dylan tells him that he must go. Marcus suddenly collapses from his heart condition and the kids are forced to take him back to the rover, only for a meteor storm to come. They manage to make it back, but Dylan's visor is cracked by a falling rock, knocking him unconscious and the front window of the rover is broken, forcing the kids to continue wearing their suits. Caleb manages to make peace with Dylan as their oxygen runs low and rescuers come.
Caleb awakens to discover that he has already been taken to Omega, devastated that he never got to say goodbye to his friends. He is given a recording device and learns that his friends are all okay and that they were allowed to send a message to him once a year during Caleb's 75-year journey to Omega. Caleb learns that Marcus started a baseball team, and that Addison started a strike to improve the contracts for the miners. They succeeded with Borney becoming the lead administrator. Dylan and Addison eventually got married, had kids, and later grandkids. Caleb comes across Charlie and the two of them share stories.

113,Knights of the Zodiac (film),"Seiya is a street orphan searching for his sister Patricia, who has been kidnapped. During a fight with Cassios in a fighting ring, Seiya unleashes a strange blue light. After the fight, he meets with Docrates and Alman Kido. Kido warns Seiya that his ex-wife Vander Guraad is looking for him.
Guraad's warriors capture Docrates and pursue Seiya and Kido, who meet up with Mylock, Kido's assistant. Following a brief chase, Seiya, Mylock and Kido escape from the warriors. Seiya demands to know what is happening, but is knocked out by Mylock. Seiya recalls his sister's kidnapping while unconscious, and is later taken to Kido's hideout.
Kido informs Seiya that his adopted daughter Sienna is the reincarnation of the goddess Athena, and Seiya is destined to become the Pegasus Knight, a warrior knight for Athena. Patricia knew about Seiya's destiny and gave herself up to protect him. Kido tells Seiya that he should train under Marin the Silver Knight, so that he can use his Cosmo to protect himself and Sienna, and to find Patricia.
While having breakfast with Seiya, Sienna briefly loses control of her Cosmo, but Kido is able to calm her down. Meanwhile, Cassios beats up several of Guraad's powerful prototype soldiers, and accepts an offer from Guraad to become one as well in exchange for exacting revenge on Seiya.
Seiya and Sienna get to know each other, and she convinces him to go to Marin for training. Seiya goes with Mylock to the mountain where Marin resides, and climbs up the mountain alone to meet with her. Seiya's training initially goes poorly, as he is unable to channel his Cosmo properly, but he keeps training with Marin's help. That night, Sienna experiences a vision of herself as Athena destroying Seiya's armor and causing widespread destruction, which causes her to emit another Cosmo burst.
Seiya eventually gains control of his Cosmo. His pendant glows and unlocks his Pegasus armor, but he experiences a vision while bonding with the armor, revealing that Kido was present when Guraad took Patricia. Seiya returns to Kido's hideout to confront him, but Sienna takes him away from the mansion. She reveals that she destroyed Guraad's arms when she was young, forcing Guraad to drain Cosmo from children with it to stay alive, and that Guraad let Patricia go when she learned that Patricia did not have any Cosmo.
Guraad arrives at Kido's hideout after her subordinate Nero tortures its location out of Docrates. Seiya and Sienna return to the mansion. Seiya fights off Guraad's soldiers, but he fails to activate his Pegasus armor while fighting Cassios, resulting in him being beaten unconscious. Kido sets his estate to self-destruct in an effort to stop Guraad, and he dies in the explosion. Sienna is knocked unconscious and captured by Guraad's soldiers, and Seiya is unable to stop them.
Guraad admits to Sienna that she has given up on fixing herself, and proceeds to start depleting Sienna's Cosmo to prevent her becoming a threat to the world. Mylock rescues Seiya, who forgives himself for being unable to rescue Patricia when she was taken. Mylock and Seiya travel to Guraad's base, where Seiya unlocks his Pegasus armor and defeats Guraad's soldiers and Cassios.
Guraad becomes unable to watch Sienna be drained of her energy and tries to stop the procedure, but Nero turns against her and assumes his Phoenix Knight form.

115,The Starling Girl,"Jem Starling is a 17-year-old girl raised in a fundamentalist Christian community in Kentucky. Her parents Paul and Heidi expect Jem to be a model Christian for her four younger siblings. Jem's age necessitates that she begin the tradition of courting, but she is more interested in dance as a member of her church's dance troupe. Owen, the pastor's 28-year-old son, has just returned to the community from doing missionary work with his wife in Puerto Rico.
When Jem learns the troupe might disband due to not having a leader, she asks Owen, who is in charge of church programs, if she can be appointed the leader, which he allows. She develops a crush on Owen and seeks ways to get closer to the older man, who is supportive of her passion for dance when others tells her she is doing it for vanity and not to praise God.
During one night when they are the only two people in the church building, they share a kiss and begin an illicit relationship. When Jem asks Owen if he thinks she is wicked, he replies he does not, and reasons that because he feels he can be himself around her, what they are doing can't possibly be a sin. He reveals his marriage to his wife Misty is an unhappy one because they married young and ""misread the signs"".
Jem's family situation becomes strained when Paul, a former alcoholic, relapses. While alone with her dad one night, Jem learns he was a singer in a band prior to converting to Christianity. He still listens to an iPod, which he keeps hidden from Heidi and swears Jem to secrecy about. When Jem asks Paul if he misses his musician life, he insists that the sacrifice is part of God's plan. The troupe is asked to show their routine to Misty, who critiques the performance and says it needs to be tweaked so it is not so centered on Jem. This angers Jem, but she reluctantly complies. After dance practice, she keys Misty's car in retaliation.
The following day, Owen confronts Jem about the car and warns her that any reckless behavior would give them away. Jem apologizes and the two make up at Owen's house, but are nearly found out when Misty arrives home early. Jem is seen by her sister while crawling out the window of his house and tells her to keep quiet about it. After this incident, Owen wants to take a break from the relationship. Jem pleads with him not to and says she think's it's time for them to go public with their relationship, but Owen angrily rebukes her.
Paul catches Jem lying to him about where she is at night and punishes her by making her quit the troupe. During their argument, Jem accuses him of lying as well, prompting him to slap her. Later, he takes an overdose of Heidi's pills, resulting in a hospitalization that leaves him in a coma. Owen's relationship with Jem is discovered when Heidi finds a burner phone given by him in her daughter's belongings. Pastor Taylor comes to the house to talk to Heidi and Jem, pointedly interrogating Jem about when the relationship started and her culpability. When Jem asks about Owen, the pastor says Owen doesn't want to be there and that his life is ruined. According to the pastor, Owen claims it was Jem who tempted him and ""inhibited his ability to control himself"". Heidi and the pastor resolve that Jem must spend some time away at a disciplinary camp. At church, Jem is asked to recant her sins in front of everyone. All the church members, including Owen, approach Jem to say, ""I forgive you.""
As Jem prepares to leave for the camp, she is stopped by Owen, who declares he has left his wife and wants to be with Jem. Heidi tries to drive him away, but Jem defies her and leaves with Owen in his car. The two take up residence at a motel. While going through her things, Jem discovers her father's iPod in her jacket pocket. The following morning, without telling Owen, she sneaks away and takes his car. She drives to a Memphis bar her father told her he used to perform at with his band. While there, a song plays and she happily dances alone to it, losing herself in the dance.

Initially hopeful that he can reach an understanding with Vainglorious, Zhi instead finds him boastful and dismissive. Vainglorious does, however, agree to challenge Zhi in an upcoming rally race for the fate of the village.

117,Fast X,"Dominic Toretto and his team are requested by the Agency to steal a computer chip during its transit in Rome. Dom and his wife Letty Ortiz stay behind with his son Brian ""Little B"" Marcos, while the rest of the team, consisting of Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, Han Lue, and Ramsey, travels to Rome. A wounded Cipher arrives at Dom's home in the middle of the night and informs him and Letty that Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, has turned her crew against her and is using them to target Dom as revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune ten years prior.[b] When Little Nobody says that there is no Agency mission in Rome, Dom and Letty realize that Dante set them up and they go to rescue the team.
In Rome, Dante releases a metal ball bomb into the streets. Dom pushes it into the Tiber River, minimizing the damage, but Letty is arrested. Agent Aimes, the Agency's de facto leader since Mr. Nobody's disappearance,[c] believes that Dom and his team are responsible for the bombing and begins a manhunt. In Los Angeles, Dom's brother Jakob rescues Little B and Mia, his and Dom's sister, from a squad sent by Dante to kidnap Little B, and with Mia's approval, takes Little B to a secret location in Portugal, where they will await Dom. Mr. Nobody's daughter, Tess, is convinced of the team's innocence and uses God's Eye[d] to find Dom in Naples, informing him that Dante is in Rio de Janeiro.
There, Dom confronts Dante and meets Isabel Neves, the sister of Little B's late mother Elena.[e] Dom later challenges Dante to a race, along with Isabel and his ally, Diogo. However, Dante wins while killing Diogo and injuring Isabel. Tess visits Letty at the black site and covertly wounds her to send her to the prison's treatment center, where Letty meets Cipher. They discover the black site is located in Antarctica and they must work together to escape. In London, Dom's team turns to Deckard Shaw for help, through the convincing of Han after a scuffle between himself and Deckard. Dom gets caught in Rio by Aimes but they both get intercepted by Dante on the same bridge where Dom killed his father. Tess gets shot by the sniper and Dante steals the God's eye from Tess.
Aimes joins forces with Dom to fight Dante. Dante locates Little B in Portugal and kidnaps him. As Dom is cornered by mercenaries, Jakob sacrifices his life to take them all out, allowing Dom to rescue his son. Dante again corners Dom and his son, just as Roman, Tej, Han, and Ramsey arrive by plane to aid Dom. Realizing too late, Dom orders Roman to turn the plane around, but Aimes, revealed to be working for Dante, shoots down the plane, leaving each member of the team's fates unknown. Dom drives off the edge of the dam they are on to avoid Dante's trap, but Dante has the dam rigged with explosives and arms them, leaving Dom and Little B's fates unknown as well. In Antarctica, Gisele Yashar, who was presumed dead,[f] emerges from a submarine to rescue Letty and Cipher.
In a mid-credits scene, Luke Hobbs infiltrates an abandoned theatre with a team of agents where he is contacted by Dante, who tells him that he will be his next target for killing his father, with Hobbs replying he isn't hard to find.

119,Master Gardener (film),"Narvel Roth is the meticulous horticulturist of Gracewood Gardens, a beautiful estate owned by wealthy dowager Mrs. Haverhill. Haunted by his past, Roth finds solace in ritualistic journaling and the fine details of gardening, which he describes as ""a belief in the future"".
Mrs. Haverhill (with whom Roth has been having a romantic relationship) orders Roth to take on her recently orphaned grandniece, Maya, as an apprentice so that she can eventually take over the Gardens and keep it ""in the family"". Though she is resistant to the training, and her relationship with Mrs. Haverhill remains strained, Maya and Roth eventually grow close. When Maya is assaulted by her drug dealer, R.G., Roth has his case agent intimidate him. Maya attempts to seduce Roth, but he rebuffs her when she tries to take off his shirt (since his shirt hides tattoos that he is trying not to show). Mrs. Haverhill spies Roth leaving Maya's room, and, spurned, fires them both. Roth and Maya decide to leave together, stopping first at Maya's apartment, where she gets high one last time and Roth intimidates R.G. and his friend Sissy.
After a few days on the road, Roth begins to open up to Maya and removes his shirt in their motel room, his White supremacist tattoos shocking Maya (unbeknownst to his team of gardeners, Roth is a former White supremacist in witness protection, having betrayed his former associates after refusing to kill a black preacher's wife and daughter). When Maya asks if Roth will have the tattoos removed, he says yes. They have sex for the first time that night.
Roth soon receives a call that the Gardens have been vandalized. They return to view the damage. Maya guesses it was R.G. and Sissy retaliating. Roth checks in on Mrs. Haverhill, whom he disarms of a (WWII) trophy Luger used to protect the house. That night, Roth and Maya go to settle matters with R.G. and Sissy, breaking up a party house with gunshots. Roth gives his gun to Maya to kill them, but she decides against it. Roth instead breaks their legs.
Roth returns to Gracewood Gardens and lays out three points for Mrs. Haverhill: Returning her father's Luger, restoring the gardens to their beauty, and that he and Maya will be living together ""as husband and wife"", which Mrs. Haverhill calls ""obscene.""[5] Haverhill vindictively takes aim at Roth, but the Luger isn't loaded, causing Haverhill to relent and let him go. Roth and Maya dance on the porch of his cabin in the Gardens.

120,Sanctuary (2022 film),"As Hal orders room service in a fancy hotel, Rebecca arrives to interview him for the position of CEO at this hotel chain. Her questions become increasingly personal and eventually turn to sexual degradation. She is in fact a dominatrix following a script that Hal has prepared to shame him. After she forces him to clean the bathroom in his underwear, she allows him to climax and the two end their scene and have dinner. He thanks her and they briefly discuss his transition to actually being CEO of the company after his father's death. He explains that he can no longer see her, as it is not appropriate in his new lifestyle and gives her an extremely expensive watch as a parting gift. She is clearly offended and leaves abruptly.
At the elevator, she has a realization and returns to the hotel room. Using some of the business philosophy that Hal's father put into his management book, she alleges that Hal's father believed Hal was weak. She is really responsible for making him the man he is. She demands half of his first year salary: $4 million. To force him into giving her the money, she alleges that she has recorded their sessions and will leak them to the public. At first Hal does not believe her, then acts as though he is undisturbed by the blackmail threat, but he eventually trashes the apartment in a rage looking for the camera as Rebecca dances to disco and mocks him.
Hal accidentally electrocutes himself. While lying on the floor humiliated, Rebecca points out that he has become aroused. Hal again says that he is actually in control of their relationship and that it is purely transactional: he has no emotional attachment to her and if he wanted, he could have her killed. Rebecca seems disturbed by this at first, but then tells Hal she is really in control of their relationship, initiating sex at knifepoint and saying that Hal will impregnate her and they will have a child together, tying the two of them together for life.
Hal goes to his laptop to arrange to have the money wired to Rebecca. She leaves once again, but this time Hal intercepts her at the elevator and demands to get some collateral to ensure that she will not keep on dragging out blackmail threats indefinitely. She refuses and insists that there is nothing he can do to be in control. He drags her back into the hotel room and demands to know what is really happening. She shows him footage of the two of them that she has secretly recorded. Hal is so despondent that he ties Rebecca to a bedpost and demands she delete the footage. Instead, she tells him that she has quit her job as a dominatrix and has even broken up with her fiancé, as she only feels self-actualized during their sessions. Horrified, Hal threatens to murder–suicide them. He demands Rebecca say she is lying, and even uses their safeword ""sanctuary"".
Instead, Rebecca proposes that they play one final game: she will become Hal's father, returned from the dead. Hal is reluctant, but she continues the roleplay and eventually leads him into the bathroom where she tells him to say, ""I am nothing like you and I never will be"" and Hal responds, ""I am nothing like you and I don't have to be"". The two embrace and fall asleep.
Rebecca awakens on the bathroom floor as Hal cleans up the apartment. The two exit at the same time and as Hal is on his way to attend a ceremony where his mother will hand over control of the company, he comes up with the idea that Rebecca can be CEO instead. This way, she can be near Hal and live the life of an independent woman who is in charge. Meanwhile, he can offer her emotional comfort, material support, and sex. Rebecca alleges that he has no way to even say that to his mother, so the plan will never work. He responds that he will say that they are in love and he is giving her his company. They kiss as the elevator opens into the lobby.

123,The Little Mermaid (2023 film),"Ariel is a mermaid princess and the youngest daughter of King Triton, ruler of the merpeople of Atlantica. She is fascinated with the human world despite never having seen it, as Triton forbids all merfolk from surfacing there after Ariel's mother was killed by a human.
One night, Ariel sees fireworks above the ocean and surfaces to see them better. They come from the ship of Eric, the prince of a nearby island. When a storm arrives, the ship crashes against rocks, forcing all to go for the lifeboats. Ariel saves Eric, brings him to shore, and sings with her siren voice to help save his life. She flees before he can regain full consciousness.
Noticing Ariel's absent-minded behavior, Triton questions his advisor Sebastian the crab, who reveals that she saved a human. Enraged, Triton travels to Ariel's grotto to confront her; when she refuses to swear to never return to the surface, he destroys her collection of human objects. Ariel is later approached by two moray eels sent by the sea witch Ursula, Triton's estranged sister and Ariel's aunt, who was banished from Atlantica 15 years prior.
At Ursula's lair, Ariel is presented with a deal: she will turn into a human for three days, during which she must receive ""true love's kiss"" to remain human permanently. If Ariel fails, she will transform back into a mermaid and Ursula will claim her. To become human, Ariel must give up her tail, the ability to breathe underwater, and her siren voice, the last of which Ursula will keep in a nautilus shell. Ariel accepts the deal. After receiving human legs, she is taken to the surface by Sergeant Major Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian. In the human world, she is rescued and taken to Eric's castle. Eric, who has been searching for the woman who saved his life, rushes to meet Ariel. However, her lack of voice has him immediately turning away, though he does allow Ariel to stay in the castle for as long as she wants. While exploring the castle, Ariel finds Eric's collection of items he accumulated over his travels. Eric spends time with her poring over his collection.
The next day, Eric takes Ariel sightseeing around the kingdom. Sebastian, who has followed Ariel, realizes that Ursula has put a cheat in the spell that is causing Ariel to forget that she needs to kiss Eric. Along with Scuttle, a northern gannet, and Flounder, Sebastian takes it upon himself to get the pair to kiss. They are almost successful but are thwarted by Ursula's eels. Enraged by the close call, Ursula turns into a human and uses Ariel's siren voice to hypnotize Eric. Back at Atlantica, Triton has the kingdom search for Ariel and begins to regret the way he treated her.
The next morning, Ariel and her friends discover that Eric will be announcing his engagement to ""Vanessa"" (Ursula's alter ego) later that day. Ariel rushes to the engagement party, confronts Ursula, and breaks the shell. She gains back her voice, and the enchantment on Eric is broken. However, before they can kiss, the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Reverting to her original form, Ursula drags Ariel back into the ocean.
Wanting to save Ariel, Triton confronts Ursula. However, the deal that she made with Ariel is unbreakable. Triton trades himself for Ariel and is turned to dust by the eels, much to her horror. Ursula claims Triton's trident just before Ariel confronts her while Eric arrives. Ursula attempts to destroy Eric, but to save Eric the second time, Ariel intervenes and intentionally attacks Ursula, who unintentionally kills her eels. Enraged, she uses the trident to grow in size and summons a storm to threaten Ariel and Eric. Ariel gets on a surfaced ship. Ursula is about to kill Eric with the trident. Saving Eric the third time, Ariel kills Ursula and impales her with its splintered bowsprit. Once Ursula dies, Triton comes back to life. Ariel picks up Triton's trident and hands it back to Triton. Triton is proud of Ariel for saving Eric three times and killing Ursula. Triton and Ariel recognize the other's sacrifice for them.
Ariel returns home, where she is unhappy without Eric. On Sebastian's advice, Triton transforms Ariel into a human permanently, and she marries Eric. The pair decide to travel together, with the blessing of both their parents and the support of people from both their worlds.

125,Kandahar (2023 film),"Tom Harris is a freelance undercover operative working for the CIA to insert malware into a secret Iranian nuclear research facility. Tom's cover is a field technician for a Swiss communications contractor. His mission is successful, and the malware causes the facility to self destruct, preventing the Iranians from acquiring more nuclear bombs.
The Iranian government has been monitoring a British journalist Luna Cujai. She receives evidence from a whistle blower of the CIA's ongoing sabotage of Iran's nuclear programs. After the facility is destroyed, she is arrested by an Iranian security agency led by Farzad. She tells the Iranians she suspects a link between the facility's destruction and the Swiss contractor because their contracts are next to government sites. The next day, Harris's partner in the operation, Oliver, is murdered by the Iranian Special Force after both Oliver and Harris's identity are compromised.
Tom leaves Iran en route to London via Dubai. While in Dubai, his flight to London is delayed, and he visits his CIA handler, Roman Chalmers. Roman is a Muslim convert, living under the outward pretense of a Dubai socialite, a lifestyle he secretly despises. Roman claims to have delayed the flight to force this meeting. Tom accepts Roman's lucrative CIA contract for a job in Herat, Afghanistan, because it will pay enough to cover his daughter’s medical university expenses.
After he arrives in Herat, due to an intelligence leak, the news names Tom as the operative responsible for the destruction of the nuclear facility. With his cover now blown, the mission in Herat is aborted. Roman directs Tom and his Afghan-American translator Mohammad “Mo” Doud to an extraction point in Kandahar. Farzad and Pakistani security services learn Tom is in Herat, and each sends operatives to apprehend him, with Pakistan wanting to ransom Tom to the highest bidder. Tom and Mo are chased by Farzad and ISI agent Kahil Nassir but they elude both pursuing parties and escape to the desert.
En route to Kandahar, Tom and Mo are attacked by Farzad in a helicopter. Tom destroys the helicopter and kills Farzad and its crew. Now on foot, Tom and Mo seek aid from Tom's friend, an Afghan warlord not associated with the governing Taliban. Mo reveals to Tom and the warlord that the warlord killed Mo's son years ago. Despite angering the warlord, he provides Tom and Mo with a vehicle and they depart the warlord's camp.
Meanwhile, Roman stops communicating with the CIA and arrives in Afghanistan to join the Afghan SF Commandos masquerading as an ISIS-K unit. Tom and Mo are captured by a Taliban warlord paid by Kahil. Tom concludes his warlord friend sold him out. Roman and the commando fighters attack the compound where Tom and Mo are held captive. The Taliban warlord is killed. Kahil arrives at the scene of the battle and realizes the attack is a ruse backed by the CIA. Roman, Tom, and Mo escape by vehicle from the compound while the battle continues. Speculating that Tom will use an old CIA airbase to extract, Kahil organizes another Taliban unit to intercept Tom.
As Tom, Roman, and Mo reach the extraction point, Kahil attacks their vehicle. Roman is mortally wounded, and jumps from the vehicle to buy the rest time. Before dying, Roman recites the Shahada. After the Taliban fighters knock out their car, Tom fights Kahil and severely wounds him. However, a CIA director orders an unauthorized missile strike on the remaining Taliban pursuers. This enables Tom and Mo to escape on a British military cargo plane. The British journalist is released while Tom and Mo reunite with their families.

Beth's agent tells her the novel needs multiple revisions, causing Beth to doubt her work. She is reassured by Don, who reads a draft of the book and suggests looking for another agent who is more enthusiastic about it. While shopping for socks, Don confesses to Beth's brother-in-law Mark that he does not like Beth's novel but feels he cannot be honest with her. Beth accidentally overhears their conversation when entering the shop with her sister Sarah, and Beth's faith in their relationship is shaken.

Despite claiming he only wanted to scare the girl, upon breaking into her house, Anthony ends up shooting Elena in her head, knocking Becky unconscious, and dognapping Diego. After Becky recovers, she vows to find her dog and take revenge for Elena's death.
Remembering that the men previously mentioned meeting with someone named Darryl, Becky finds two local addresses linked to that name. The first location leads Becky to an elderly woman identified as Darryl Sr. The second leads Becky to a remote cabin where Noble Men cell leader Darryl hosts a meeting with Anthony, DJ, Sean, and another militia member known as Twig. Becky sneaks into the cabin and finds evidence that a town hall protest planned for the next day will actually be an armed insurrection against Senator Hernandez. Becky also steals a secret thumb drive containing membership information on everyone associated with the Noble Men.
Becky leaves a cellphone on Darryl's doorstep that she uses to taunt the men. Becky's arrival forces Anthony, DJ, and Sean to confess to dognapping her dog, but they do not say anything to Darryl about having murdered Elena.
Darryl makes Anthony go after Becky. Becky leads Anthony into a hidden pit in the forest. She then rigs Anthony with a grenade trap that blows up his head when Darryl reopens the front door. After Darryl turns his gun on them to demand the truth about Becky, DJ and Sean reveal Elena's murder. Realizing the rally will actually be a violent insurrection, Sean has a change of heart and tries abandoning the group, but Darryl beats Sean and breaks his neck, killing him.
Becky calls Darryl to continue taunting him. She threatens to expose the plot against Senator Hernandez and also reveals that she stole Darryl's incriminating thumb drive. Twig goes outside looking for Becky. Becky fires a crossbow bolt through Twig's cheeks. Fearful of both Becky and Darryl, DJ runs to their truck and drives away.
Twig and Becky have a protracted faceoff ultimately ending with Becky using a machete to hack Twig to death. However, Darryl uses a tranquilizer dart to take Becky captive.
Becky wakes to find herself tied to a chair. Darryl shows Becky that he stole her keepsake key, and that a hidden shaft inside the key's cylinder contains engraved numbers he presumes to be coordinates. Revealing herself to be Darryl's mother as well as the secret mastermind behind the Noble Men, the elderly woman Becky previously met as Darryl Sr. arrives at the cabin. Darryl Sr. uses Becky's dog to taunt Becky while demanding to know where the thumb drive is.
Becky breaks free from her restraints. Darryl leaves the room to recover after Becky sprays him with mace. Darryl Sr. moves to shoot Diego, but Becky throws a knife into her forehead. Darryl Jr. chases Becky into the forest outside. Becky leads Darryl into animal traps that pin his legs and clamp around his throat.  He whispers ""Well done"" and dies. Becky retrieves her key. Becky returns to the cabin for Diego and discovers that Darryl Sr. survived. Darryl Sr. tries to shoot Becky, but is unable to aim properly due to her head injury. Becky has Diego maul Darryl Sr. to death.
Twenty-four hours later, CIA agent Kate Montana interviews Becky about the thumb drive and singlehandedly taking down a Noble Men cell. Agent Montana offers to recruit Becky and Becky agrees. Montana then asks if Becky is ready to find out what her key belongs to.
DJ tries to get back on the road after his truck breaks down. Dressed in a black suit, Becky drives up to the scene in an official law enforcement vehicle. She uses a rocket launcher to blow up DJ's truck and kill him.

129,Reality (2023 film),"On May 9, 2017, Reality Winner watches Fox News coverage on the firing of James Comey by President Donald Trump on the TV at her office. 25 days later, on June 3, Winner returns home from grocery shopping, where she is confronted by FBI agents Taylor and Garrick, who explain they have a warrant to search her house and her belongings. As a team of agents arrive and begin searching the house, Winner engages in casual conversation with the agents, all of which is picked up by recording device, the transcript of which forms the basis of the film's dialogue. During the early portion of the recording, Winner expresses concern for her dog's and cat's safety during the search.
Winner agrees to speak with Taylor and Garrick in an empty, disused bedroom in her house. Garrick and Taylor start to ask her about the specifics of her work. She explains, besides working as a yoga instructor and CrossFit trainer, she is a Farsi translator for a government contractor and is hoping to be deployed to Afghanistan as a translator so her fluency in Pashto can be better utilized. The agents eventually reveal they are questioning Winner about the recent leak of classified government documents to an online publication. Winner initially denies knowledge, but over the course of an hour is eventually compelled to confess she printed and leaked a document from the National Security Agency's database. The film initially redacts specifics of the leak, as is done in the transcript, but it is eventually revealed that the documents revealed proof of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and the publication was The Intercept, which had put out a call for evidence of Russian interference.
Winner denies wishing to be a whistleblower or to undermine the intelligence community à la Edward Snowden, instead saying she wanted the American public to have the same information the government had about the election. As the interrogation wraps up, she chiefly expresses concern for her pets as she realizes she will be taken into custody. She is escorted out of her house and handcuffed, as footage is shown of media reports about the leak. Winner receives both praise and criticism for her actions, with some accusing her of colluding with the Middle East or denying the veracity of the leaks altogether. Some outlets criticize The Intercept for allowing the leak to be traced to Winner, and others theorize that Winner's punishment was designed to discourage potential whistleblowers.
A textual epilogue explains that Winner was denied bail and charged under the Espionage Act. She spent four years in jail and will remain on supervised release until November 2024. It notes that the same document Winner leaked was later used on the Senate floor as evidence of Russian interference.

130,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"On Earth-65, police captain George Stacy is unaware that his daughter Gwen Stacy is Spider-Woman, who the police believe to be a murderer. One night, Gwen encounters a version of the Vulture from an Italian Renaissance–themed alternate universe. Miguel O'Hara and Jess Drew arrive using portal-generating watches and help Gwen neutralize the Vulture. George corners Gwen, who then reveals her identity to him; distraught, he attempts to arrest her. Miguel reluctantly grants Gwen membership into the Spider-Society, allowing her to escape with him and Jess.
In Brooklyn on Earth-1610, sixteen months after the Alchemax collider's explosion,[a] Miles Morales encounters the Spot, an Alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during the explosion. The Spot blames Miles for causing his condition and reveals that, while testing the collider, he had transported a spider from another dimension, Earth-42, which then bit Miles and turned him into Spider-Man. The Spot then accidentally transports himself into a void, where he learns to travel to other universes containing Alchemax colliders to empower himself further.
Gwen travels to Earth-1610 and reconnects with Miles while tracking the Spot. Miles secretly follows her through a portal to Earth-50101, and they team up with local Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar, and later Hobie Brown, against the Spot, who absorbs the power of that world's collider. The Spot and Miles share a vision of the Spot's future attacks that include the deaths of Police Inspector Singh (the father of Pavitr's girlfriend Gayatri) and Miles' father Jeff. The Spot departs and the collider collapses; Miles saves Singh from the ensuing destruction, but Earth-50101 begins to fall apart from its disrupted ""canon event"" before members of the Society arrive to contain the damage. Miles, Gwen, and Hobie are sent to the Society's headquarters on Earth-928, where hundreds of Spider-People reside in a massive complex.
Miles, along with Gwen and Hobie, meets with Miguel and reunites with Peter B. Parker, who is accompanied by his infant daughter Mayday. Miguel explains to Miles that each of the Spider-People's stories throughout the multiverse contain ""canon events"", such as the deaths of a police captain close to Spider-Man, and that straying from these events threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse, which in turn will collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. Miguel reveals that he witnessed the collapse of another universe firsthand when attempting to replace a deceased version of himself from that universe.
Miles realizes that the Spot murdering Jeff, who is set to be promoted to police captain in two days, is a canon event. Miguel imprisons Miles to prevent him from saving Jeff, but Hobie helps Miles break loose before quitting the Society. As Miles flees through the complex, Miguel orders the Society to capture him. Miguel corners Miles and tells him that he is the original anomaly: Miles was never supposed to be Spider-Man, as the spider that bit him came from Earth-42, resulting in Earth-42 having no Spider-Man, and that if the spider had not bitten Miles, Earth-1610's Peter Parker would have stopped the collider and survived, and the Spot would never have existed.
Miles overpowers Miguel and flees to what he believes is his home dimension. Considering Gwen a liability, a furious Miguel ejects her from the Society and forcibly sends her back to Earth-65. Once there, Gwen reunites with George, who has resigned from his job as police captain. The two reconcile, and George gives Gwen a portal watch left by Hobie.
Miles realizes that he is on Earth-42, the home of the spider that bit him, rather than his own dimension. In this world, his uncle Aaron Davis is alive while his father is dead; because Spider-Man does not exist, New York City is riddled with unchecked crime. Aaron restrains Miles and is soon joined by Earth-42's Miles, who has become the Prowler. As the Society searches for Miles in Earth-1610, Gwen travels there and speaks with his parents, promising to find him and bring him home. The Spot begins his multiversal attack, Miles prepares to escape, and Gwen assembles a team to find Miles, consisting of Peter B., Mayday, Pavitr, Hobie, Margo Kess, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham.

Twelve years later, in 2012, Hae Sung has finished his military service and Nora has moved to New York City. One day, Nora discovers on Facebook that Hae Sung had posted that he was looking for Na Young, unaware of her name change. They reconnect through video calls but are unable to visit each other, as Nora plans to attend a writer's retreat in Montauk and Hae Sung is moving to China for a Mandarin language exchange.

134,Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,"The planet-eating Unicron attacks the homeworld of the Maximals, an advanced race of Transformers. The Terrorcons, Unicron’s heralds led by Scourge, want the Transwarp Key which can open portals through space and time and can help Unicron consume planets faster. The Maximal leader Apelinq sacrifices himself to allow the other Maximals to escape the planet before Unicron devours it. Now under the command of Optimus Primal, the Maximals flee to Earth with the key.
In 1994 Brooklyn, Noah Diaz, an ex-military electronics expert, struggles to find a job to support his ill brother Kris and is convinced by his friend Reek to steal a Porsche to sell only to discover that it is the Autobot Mirage in disguise. Concurrently, museum intern Elena Wallace studies an ancient statue of a falcon bearing the Maximal symbol and accidentally breaks it open to reveal the key hidden inside. The key releases an energy pulse detected by Autobot leader Optimus Prime, who summons the other Autobots, including Arcee and Bumblebee. Mirage is contacted in the middle of Noah's attempted theft, and he is roped into the Autobots' mission to recover the key so they can use it to return to their homeworld, Cybertron.
Drawn by the key's signature, the Terrorcons arrive on Earth and attack the Autobots outside the museum, with Elena becoming caught up in the conflict. Scourge kills Bumblebee, steals the key, and retreats when the Maximal Airazor arrives. Airazor reveals that the Maximals have been hiding on Earth for millennia, and Scourge only has half of the Transwarp Key, which was split in two to keep it away from Unicron. Optimus insists that the key be reassembled so the Autobots can use it to return home, while Noah secretly plots to destroy the key to keep Earth safe.
Elena deduces that the other half of the key is in a hidden temple in Peru. The cargo plane Autobot, Stratosphere takes them to Peru, where they meet with Wheeljack, who leads them to the temple. However, the other half of the key is revealed to no longer be there. The Terrorcons attack again, and Scourge corrupts Airazor with Unicron's dark energy. Subsequently, the Autobots meet Optimus Primal and the other Maximals, who entrusted the second half of the key to a human tribe they have worked with for millennia. Scourge's corruption overtakes Airazor, whom Primal reluctantly kills at her request to save Elena. In the chaos, Noah attempts to destroy the second half of the key, but Optimus convinces him otherwise. Scourge steals it and then reassembles the two halves, erecting a tower and opening a portal above the Earth, which Unicron will soon go through.
Optimus and Noah agree to work together to protect their homeworlds from Unicron. While Autobots and Maximals battle the Terrorcon army, Noah and Elena sneak in close to the Key, planning to deactivate it with an access code Elena has uncovered. During the battle, Scourge wounds Mirage, who was protecting Noah, but transforms his damaged body into a powered exo-suit for Noah so they can fight together. Bumblebee is reactivated when the key activates the Energon-infused valley. He helps the Autobots and Maximals turn the tide of the battle. Optimus kills Scourge, but not before the latter damages the control console to prevent the portal from being shut down. Optimus destroys the key and collapses the portal, willing to sacrifice himself, but Noah and Primal save him from being sucked into the imploding vortex, which destroys the remaining Terrorcon army and leaves Unicron stranded.
In the aftermath, the Autobots, unable to return to Cybertron, proclaim Earth as their new home and vow to continue protecting it alongside the Maximals. Elena receives recognition for discovering the temple in Peru while Noah attends an interview for a security job but finds he is actually being invited to join the secret military organization G.I. Joe, who will cover Kris's healthcare.
In a mid-credits scene, Noah repairs Mirage using junk Porsche parts from Reek who claims it is unroad-worthy, and Noah disproves him by calling to Mirage to transform in front of Reek.

135,Flamin' Hot,"In 1966 southern California, Richard Montañez grows up as a hard working child with a strict father and supportive grandfather. He meets his future wife Judy in school where he begins selling burritos to other children. He is arrested at a young age when nobody believes that he earned his money honestly. As adults, Richard and Judy marry but live as hoodlums in a gang, hustling to survive. They make an effort to turn their lives around once Judy gets pregnant with their first child. A second child later, Richard and his family still struggle to make ends meet as Richard searches for honest work. He eventually turns to his friend, former hoodlum Tony Romero, who helps him get a job at Frito-Lay. Despite lying on his resumé, floor head Lonny Mason hires him.
Richard begins paying attention to all the nuances of the factory and starts pursuing engineer maintenance leader Clarence C. Baker to teach him about the machines. Despite some reluctance, Baker agrees and teaches Richard how to operate all the machinery in the factory. Unfortunately, the Reagan administration begins to severely affect low-paying jobs and Frito-Lay's stocks begin to go down. This eventually results in some of the workers getting laid off. Frito-Lay CEO Roger Enrico releases a video encouraging the workers to ""think like a CEO"" which inspires Richard.
After picking up his kids from school, Richard takes them out for elotes (Mexican street corn). Noticing that his youngest son Steven likes the spicy flavor, saying it “burns good”, he realizes that the way to save Frito-Lay is to pitch the brand to the Latino market. He convinces Baker and the rest of his coworkers to let him take some unflavored Cheetos home, but Judy offers that he talk to his father Vacho first about a job. Vacho ends up belittling Richard's plans, causing Judy to support Richard even more. The Montañezes work tirelessly trying to find the perfect spicy flavor for Cheetos, eventually getting the right concoction. Richard attempts to pitch his idea to Lonny only to be turned down, forcing Richard to sneak in and copy Enrico's phone number.
Richard manages to get through to Enrico who, while perplexed over being called by a janitor, is intrigued to learn that he saw his video and asks that he send his flavored Cheetos. He tastes them and is immediately hooked, setting up a meeting at the factory right away. While Lonny is upset with Richard, Richard prepares himself for the pitch, finally getting the approval of his father to back him up. Richard proceeds to speak from the heart and his pitch is accepted with the Flamin' Hot Cheetos being put into production. While this results in more jobs, the new flavor is not flying off the shelves. Disappointed, Richard's children point out that there are no advertisements for the flavor. Richard returns to work and orders everyone to use their skills to sell the new flavor from the street. The tactic works and Enrico calls to ask that the factory produce an even bigger order.
While Baker gets the promotion he always desired, Richard is still a janitor, though Baker gives him some support. Lonny asks Richard to clean upstairs, only to find Enrico who tells him that he understands his struggles growing up, before revealing that he has been promoted to Director of Multicultural Marketing. Richard is applauded by all his coworkers for his success and he happily calls Judy to tell her the good news.

138,The Flash (film),"After helping Bruce Wayne / Batman and Diana Prince / Wonder Woman stop a robbery in Gotham City, Barry Allen revisits his childhood home, where he lived with his parents Nora and Henry, before Henry's wrongful imprisonment for Nora's murder.[a] On the day of her death, Nora sent Henry to the grocery store for a can of tomatoes that she forgot to buy, leaving her alone in the kitchen, resulting in her being killed by an unidentified assailant.[b] Overcome by emotions, Barry accidentally uses the Speed Force to form a ""Chronobowl"" and travel back in time earlier in the day. Despite Bruce's warnings of time travel's unintended consequences, Barry time travels and places the can of tomatoes in Nora's cart at the store, so that his father will not have to leave the house. As he returns to the present, Barry is knocked out of the Chronobowl by an unknown speedster and ends up in a 2013 where Nora is alive. He encounters his parents, his past self, and realizes this is the day he originally obtained his powers.
To make sure his past self gains superpowers, the two Barrys go to the Central City Police Department, where Barry re-enacts the event for 2013-Barry to be struck by lightning. Both end up getting struck by the lightning, giving 2013-Barry powers, but causing Barry to lose his own. As Barry struggles to train 2013-Barry on properly using his powers, they learn that General Zod is preparing to invade Earth.[c] In an effort to fight Zod, the Barrys attempt to assemble the Justice League but are unsuccessful; in this timeline, Diana cannot be located, Victor Stone has not gained his abilities yet, and Arthur Curry never existed. They travel to Wayne Manor, hoping to find Bruce, but instead find an alternate variant who has long retired. Bruce theorizes that using time travel to alter history affects events both prior to and after the alteration. They convince Bruce to return as Batman and help them find Kal-El / Superman.
The Barrys and Batman locate a Kryptonian pod discovered in Siberia. Upon arrival, they instead find Kal-El's cousin, Kara Zor-El, imprisoned in the facility. They rescue Kara and return to Wayne Manor. Barry enlists Bruce's help to regain his power once more. The first two attempts fail, prompting Kara to fly Barry into a storm, where he regains his powers. Kara and Batman join the Barrys to fight Zod and his forces. During the battle, Kara learns that Zod had intercepted Kal-El's escape pod from Krypton and killed him while attempting to extract the Codex needed to repopulate the Kryptonian species. Zod reveals that the Codex is actually within Kara. Zod subdues and kills her, then extracts the Codex from her blood; meanwhile, Batman sacrifices himself in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy Zod's ship.
The Barrys repeatedly time travel to save Batman and Kara but keep failing. Barry realizes that this sequence of events cannot be changed, but 2013-Barry keeps trying. As 2013-Barry travels, the multiverse starts to implode. The unknown speedster who initially knocked Barry out of the Speed Force returns and is revealed to be an older, future version of 2013-Barry who still believes he can defeat Zod and save his Earth. He becomes angry when Barry reveals his intention to reverse the changes he made to the timeline by letting Nora die. The elder 2013-Barry attempts to kill Barry, but instead impales young 2013-Barry, who sacrifices himself to save Barry and wipe his future self from the timeline.
Barry reverts the timeline and comes to terms with his mother's death; however, he subtly alters the past by moving the tomato cans to a higher shelf. Returning to the present day, Barry attends Henry's court hearing, where the security footage now reveals Henry looking up to grab the tomato can, allowing for his exoneration. Barry is then contacted by Bruce, whose appearance has changed once again as a result of the timeline alteration.

139,Elemental (2023 film),"Fire elements Bernie[b] and Cinder[c] Lumen immigrate to Element City where they face xenophobia from other classical elements. After the birth of their daughter Ember,[d] they set up their Blue Flame which represents their traditions and start their own convenience store called the Fireplace. Several years later, Bernie intends to retire and give Ember the store once she can control her fiery temper. One day, when Bernie allows Ember to run the shop on her own, she becomes overwhelmed by the customers and rushes to the basement. Her fiery outburst breaks a water pipe, flooding the basement and summoning Wade Ripple, a water element and city inspector, who notes the faulty plumbing. Despite Ember's attempts to stop him, Wade travels to City Hall and reluctantly files a report of his findings with his air element employer, Gale Cumulus, who will have the Fireplace shut down.
Wade brings Ember to Cyclone Stadium to persuade Gale to reconsider the shutdown of her father's store. Wade mentions to Ember that he was investigating a leak in the city's canals before ending up at the Fireplace, and suggests to Gale that he and Ember can track the source of the leak from the store. Gale offers to forgive the violations as long as they find and seal the leak by the end of the week. While searching the canals, Ember and Wade discover a hole in a dam that allows wave runoff from ships to flood the city's plumbing, so they close the hole with sandbags. The two spend time together in the city and learn more about each other. The sandbags eventually fail, so Ember melts the sand into glass to form a sturdier seal. Ember visits Wade's family at a luxury apartment, where she uses her fire to fix a broken glass pitcher, impressing Wade's mother Brook, who recommends her for a glassmaking internship. While playing ""the Crying Game"", Wade makes Ember cry by admitting he has feelings for her. Gale calls Wade and approves Ember's glass seal, thus saving the Fireplace from closure. Ember then realizes that she does not want to take over the store.
Bernie announces his intention to retire and hand the Fireplace to Ember. The next evening, Wade takes Ember to Garden Central Station to see Vivisteria flowers, a species that can thrive in any environment, which she was denied seeing in childhood. With the station now flooded, Gale provides Ember with an air bubble for safety while Wade pushes her underwater through the station. Afterward, Ember and Wade realize that they are able to touch without harming each other and share a dance, but Ember remembers her duty to the Fireplace and her family's prejudice against water elements, and breaks up with Wade. While Ember is about the take over the Fireplace during a party, Wade appears and declares his love for her, while also accidentally revealing that she caused the broken pipe. Ember rejects Wade, though Cinder senses genuine affection. Disappointed, Bernie refuses to give Ember the store and calls off his retirement.
Soon after, the new seal on the dam breaks and Firetown floods. After saving the Blue Flame, Ember and Wade become trapped in a room in the Fireplace, causing Wade to evaporate from the enclosed heat. After the flood recedes, a grief-stricken Ember confesses to Bernie that she does not want to run the Fireplace and expresses her love for Wade. Realizing that Wade has condensed within the stone ceiling, Ember plays the Crying Game to get him to drip back into his normal form. Ember and Wade embrace and share their first kiss.
Months later, Bernie has retired and the Fireplace is now run by friends of his. Ember and Wade, now a couple, leave Element City so that Ember can start her internship.

140,Asteroid City,"In a retro-futuristic version of the 1950s, a television host introduces a documentary about the creation and production of Asteroid City, a play by the famed playwright Conrad Earp. The play's events are depicted in widescreen and stylized color, while the television special is seen in black-and-white Academy ratio.
In the play, a youth astronomy convention is held in the fictional desert town of Asteroid City. War photojournalist Augie Steenbeck arrives early to the Junior Stargazer convention with Woodrow, his intellectual teenage son, and his three younger daughters. When their car breaks down, Augie phones his father-in-law, Stanley, asking his help. Stanley, who dislikes his son-in-law, persuades him to tell the children about their mother's recent death, which Augie had concealed. Augie and Woodrow meet Midge Campbell, a famous but world-weary actress, and her daughter Dinah, who, like Woodrow, will be honored at the convention. Augie and Midge, and Woodrow and Dinah, gradually fall in love throughout the play. The other convention participants arrive: five-star General Grif Gibson, astronomer Dr. Hickenlooper, three additional teenaged honorees (Ricky, Clifford, and Shelly) and their parents (J.J., Roger, and Sandy), a busload of elementary-school children chaperoned by young teacher June Douglas, and a cowboy band led by singer Montana. A local motel provides everyone's accommodations.
Gibson welcomes the attendees at the Asteroid City crater where the teenagers are to receive awards for various inventions. A UFO suddenly appears above the crater; an alien emerges and steals the remnant of the meteorite that created the crater. Augie photographs the alien. General Gibson, with instructions from the president, places the town under military quarantine, and everyone is subjected to medical and psychiatric examinations. Meanwhile, a romance blossoms between Montana and June, who assure the students that the alien is likely peaceful. The Stargazer honorees use Dr. Hickenlooper's equipment to attempt to contact the alien. Tricking the guard watching the pay phone, Ricky calls his school newspaper to relay the quarantine details and cover-up to the outside world.
The Asteroid City events become national news. A furious General Gibson is about to end the quarantine when the UFO reappears, dropping the meteorite back into its former position; the General sees new markings on it and deduces that it has been ""inventoried."" Gibson reinstates the quarantine; the children, scientists, and parents revolt, using the honorees' inventions to overpower the military. In the play's epilogue, Augie and his family are the last to leave Asteroid City after General Gibson lifts the quarantine. Woodrow reveals he has won the fellowship funding, and Midge leaves Augie her mailing address. Augie and his family quietly drive away.
Throughout the film, the play's creation is interspersed with the play itself in the television documentary. Some time after Conrad Earp started writing, he meets with actor Jones Hall, who performs an audition in Earp's home and is immediately cast. During the same interaction, Earp and Hall kiss, establishing their relationship as lovers. Earp writes the play with help from a local acting school and recruits most cast members from it, including Mercedes Ford, a temperamental yet talented actress who plays Midge.
During the recorded performance of the play, Hall, who plays Augie, confronts the play's director Schubert Green, saying he ""still doesn't understand the play"", and asks Green if he is ""doing him right"". Green tells Hall to keep playing Augie the same way despite being uncertain, and that he is doing him right. After that interaction, while taking a smoke break on a balcony, Hall runs into the actress who was cast to play Augie's wife before her only scene was cut. She recites the deleted scene's text to him, and he appears to gain new insight from it.
Six months into the play's run, Conrad Earp dies in an automobile accident.

141,Extraction 2,"After barely surviving a previous mission in Dhaka, Tyler Rake retires from mercenary work to a cabin in Austria to recuperate. Tyler is later approached by a stranger called Alcott and asked to rescue Tyler's ex-wife Mia's sister Ketevan and her two children Sandro and Nina. Ketevan married Davit Radiani, one of the co-leaders of the largest crime syndicate of Georgia called Nagazi, which Davit founded with his brother Zurab. After having thrown a DEA agent off a roof, Davit was imprisoned and unable to bribe his way out due to the pressure from the Americans. Davit forces Ketevan and her children to move into the prison to keep them from leaving him, but the poor living conditions and Davit's abuse cause Ketevan to call Mia for help.
Tyler recruits Nik and her brother Yaz to join him, where they infiltrate the prison with the help of a bribed guard. However, the prisoners are alerted and a riot ensues. During the extraction, Davit attacks Tyler and Ketevan, resulting in Tyler killing him. Tyler and Ketevan fight their way through the riot, but manage to board an armored train. After fighting off Nagazi forces and corrupt soldiers, they get on a plane and escape to Vienna, but Sandro, who had idolized his father and was influenced by the Nagazi's cult-like loyalty, secretly contacts Zurab and reveals their location. Zurab and his men find and attack Tyler and his team in their DC Towers safehouse in Vienna. Ketevan scolds Sandro for endangering his own family and naivete. In the chaos, Sandro abandons his mother and joins Zurab.
After killing most of Zurab's men, the team flees in one of his helicopters, but Zurab mortally wounds Yaz. The team retreats to Tyler's cabin, where he and Ketevan are reunited with Mia. Tyler apologizes to Mia for leaving on a mission before their son died from cancer, regretful that the last memory he had was Tyler leaving him. Zurab's right-hand man and uncle Avtandil discourages Zurab from seeking revenge to prevent more losses and to set a better example for his nephew. Refusing to accept defeat, Zurab kills Avtandil and contacts Tyler, telling him to meet at a nearby airfield next to a church. Tyler heads to the airfield, but leaves Nik behind in order to prevent risking her life. Tyler kills the remaining Nagazi and finds Zurab and Sandro in the church, with Sandro wearing an explosive vest.
Zurab forces Sandro to take Tyler's pistol, but Sandro refuses to shoot Tyler after realizing his mistake and the kind of men Davit and Zurab really are. Nik arrives and disarms the vest, while Tyler fights and kills Zurab. Nik and Tyler are captured by police and imprisoned. Mia visits Tyler and informs him that Ketevan and her children have been moved to protective custody, but their assets have been frozen. Tyler tells her to give them $1 million cash, which is hidden under the floorboards in his cabin. Mia assures Tyler that their son died confident his father was a hero. Tyler and Nik are taken out of prison to meet with Alcott, who assigns them to another mission in return for their freedom.

142,The Blackening (film),"Morgan and Shawn arrive to a cabin in the woods where they plan on celebrating Juneteenth with their group of friends. In the basement, the couple discovers a board game called ""The Blackening"", which features a racist Little Black Sambo caricature.
Suddenly, the lights go out and a mysterious voice demands that the couple play. Shawn answers a question incorrectly and is promptly killed with an arrow to the neck. Morgan attempts to escape but is captured.
The next day, Lisa, Allison, and Dewayne make their way to the cabin and discuss King bringing Lisa's unfaithful ex-boyfriend Nnamdi for the weekend's festivities. On her way to the cabin, Shanika runs into a former schoolmate named Clifton at the gas station, who reveals he is also joining the group.
Before leaving, Shanika is unnerved by the facially disfigured clerk  who stands by her menacingly. Once the group is all together, they find Ranger White not allowing them entry. After settling the dispute, the friends begin to set up for a night of partying.
After drinks, drugs, and games ensue, the group questions who specifically invited Clifton. After the lights go out again, the friends go to find a power box, only to come across The Blackening with game pieces correlating to their personalities. The voice speaks to them, revealing that he is keeping Morgan prisoner.
The voice forces the friends to play the game to save Morgan and begins by asking trivia questions about African-American culture. Unfortunately, the friends fail to sufficiently answer a question about all the black actors that guest-starred on Friends and Morgan is attacked.
They are ordered to sacrifice one of their own based on whom they deem to be ""the blackest""; the least black person will be sacrificed. Each of them comes up with their own defense, but everyone ends up choosing Clifton after he admits he voted for Donald Trump in both elections.
Clifton goes outside and is shot in the chest with an arrow by the killer. When the friends are freed from the room, they attempt to go look for Morgan and find help. Despite knowing better, they agree with Allison's idea to split up.
She goes off with King and Shanika while Dewayne has to go with Lisa and Nnamdi. The latter three end up running into Ranger White, who is willing to help them until the killer shoots him in the neck with an arrow.
Allison, King, and Shanika encounter the killer, and the trio manage to overpower and kill him. They unmask him to find that it's the clerk that Shanika saw at the gas station. Lisa, Nnamdi, and Dewayne then encounter a second killer before Lisa bashes his brains in. They look through his pockets to see that he is the first killer's twin brother, and they deduce someone hired them to be there.
The friends go into another room where they find Ranger White's and Clifton's bodies, only for the latter to spring awake and reveal himself as the mastermind. He blames the group for always doubting his level of ""blackness"" when they knew each other at college, with this doubt leading to an incident where he drank heavily and ended up killing a woman when driving on the road.
After serving four years in prison for the DUI, he organized the entire night as revenge and prepares to kill the others before dropping them down a well where he dumped Shawn's and Morgan's corpses. The friends fight back before kicking him down the well to his apparent death.
As the morning arrives, the friends are skeptical of calling the police for help. On the advice of Dewayne, they call the fire department instead, only for them to be sprayed with a hose.

144,No Hard Feelings (2023 film),"32-year-old Maddie Barker is an Uber driver and bartender in Montauk, New York. As she owes property taxes on a home she inherited from her mother, her car is repossessed and she faces bankruptcy. Desperate to keep the home, she accepts an unusual Craigslist posting. Wealthy couple Alison and Laird Becker ask her to ""date"" their 19-year-old son Percy in exchange for a Buick Regal. Since Percy is shy and has had no experiences with girls, drinking, parties, or sex, his parents hope to boost his confidence before he attends Princeton University.
Maddie attempts to seduce Percy at the animal shelter where he volunteers. However, after she offers him a ride home, he thinks that she is attempting to kidnap him and pepper sprays her. Despite this, they agree to go on a date the following day. Maddie and Percy meet at a bar the next night and then go skinny dipping at the beach.

Percy meets a school acquaintance, Natalie, who invites him to a party in the restaurant. After he and Maddie disagree about their long-term plans, he goes to the party while Maddie searches for him.

Maddie's close friends, Jim and Sara, tell her they are moving out of Montauk to Florida due to housing costs. Sara asks Maddie if she really wants to stay in Montauk or if she is just doing it for her mother.
After reflecting on her life, Maddie reunites with Percy at a Princeton mixer and apologizes. Unconvinced, Percy starts to drive off when Maddie jumps on the hood of his car. Unable to see, Percy crashes the car into the ocean. As the car is towed, the pair reconcile and promise to stay friends. Maddie decides to sell the house to Jim and Sara and move to California to pursue her passion for surfing.
Later, Maddie drives Percy to Princeton while on her way to California, and reveals that she has adopted Milo, a former police dog addicted to cocaine who lived at the shelter where Percy had volunteered. Maddie promises to call Percy during her entire drive to California.

146,World's Best,"Prem Patel is a 12-year-old math genius who lives with his widowed mother Priya. He aims to be the best and takes high school level mathematics, which he excels at. After taking an entrance exam, Ms. Sage gives the class a homework assignment to use math to describe who they are. Prem asks Priya what his late father Suresh was like and she regales the story of how they first met when he was just an up-and-coming rapper, a dream he never got to achieve due to cancer. Prem looks at his father's old things and is suddenly visited by a manifestation of Suresh who has come to help him discover himself. Prem starts to imagine himself becoming a rapper like his father and embraces the lifestyle.
Prem's best friend, Jerome, joins up with school bullies Brooklyn and Sharn for a talent competition, and tries to avoid fellow mathematics genius Claire due to her odd appearance. Prem also joins the talent competition using the name ""World's Best Emcee"". He uses his father's old rhymes book to garner inspiration, but when Brooklyn and Sharn put Prem on the spot, he panics, but is rescued by older students Mercedes and Gabe who take a liking to him and bond with him over hip hop and math.

149,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"In 1944, Nazis capture Indiana Jones and Oxford archeologist Basil Shaw as they attempt to retrieve the Lance of Longinus from a castle in the French Alps. Astrophysicist Jürgen Voller informs his superiors the Lance is fake, but he has found half of Archimedes' Dial, an Antikythera mechanism built by the ancient Syracusan mathematician Archimedes which reveals time fissures, allowing for possible time travel. Indy escapes onto a Berlin-bound train filled with looted antiquities and frees Basil. He obtains the Dial piece, and the two leap from the train just before Allied forces derail it.
Twenty-five years later, in 1969, Indy is retiring from Hunter College in New York City. His wife, Marion, has recently filed for legal separation after their son Mutt was killed in the Vietnam War. Helena Shaw, Indy's goddaughter, visits him and wants to research the Dial. Indy warns that her deceased father, Basil, became obsessed with studying the Dial before relinquishing his half to Indy to destroy, which he never did.
As Indy and Helena retrieve the Dial half from the college archives, Voller's accomplices attack them. The CIA assists Voller, now working for NASA on the Apollo program. Helena, revealed as an antiquities smuggler, absconds with the Dial to auction it on the black market. Indy is framed for two colleagues' murders, forcing him to escape through both the New York ticker-tape parade for the crew of Apollo 11 and an anti-war protest. He seeks out old friend Sallah, now a New York cab driver.
Sallah surmises Helena will likely auction the Dial in Tangier, then helps Indy flee the country. At a Tangier hotel, Indy disrupts Helena's illegal private auction, but Voller and his henchmen arrive and steal the artifact. Indy, Helena, and her teen sidekick, Teddy Kumar, chase them through the streets in a tuk-tuk. The CIA intercepts Voller after the U.S. government disavows him for going rogue, but his cohorts murder the agents and steal their helicopter.
Indy, Helena, and Teddy trail Voller to Greece and team up with Indy's old friend, Renaldo, a professional sea diver. Guided by Basil's research, they dive to an ancient Aegean Sea shipwreck and retrieve a ""Grafikos"" tablet containing directions to the Dial's other half. Helena asks Indy where in history he would go if he gets the dial, to which he tearfully replies, back to stop Mutt from enlisting to fight in Vietnam, thus preventing Mutt's death and the disintegration of his and Marion's marriage. Voller arrives and murders Renaldo. Indy's group escapes and heads to Sicily, pursued by Voller, who kidnaps Teddy there.
Inside the Ear of Dionysius cavern, Indy and Helena find Archimedes' tomb and the Dial's second half. The pair also discover a 20th-century wristwatch on Archimedes' skeleton and a carving of a phoenix with propellers on his tomb. Voller appears and captures Indy, wounding him. Helena and Teddy escape and chase Voller. After reassembling the Dial, Voller reveals his plans to time travel back to 1939 to assassinate Adolf Hitler and help lead Germany to victory in World War II. At an airfield, Voller activates the Dial and locates a time fissure in the sky. Indy is held captive on Voller's stolen plane while Helena stows away through its landing gear. Teddy follows them in another plane.
While approaching the fissure, Indy realizes that continental drift could have altered the timeline coordinates. Rather than 1939, the group arrives at the Siege of Syracuse in 214 BC. The warring armies shoot down Voller's plane, believing it is a dragon. Indy and Helena parachute out just before the plane crashes, killing everyone aboard, while Teddy lands safely. Archimedes investigates the crash and finds Voller's body, wristwatch, and the Dial in the wreckage. Archimedes tells Indy and Helena that he created the Dial to bring users from the future through fissures that lead only to his time, in order to obtain their assistance in the battle against the overwhelming Roman force. As the fissure begins to collapse, a wounded Indy decides to remain behind, feeling he has nothing to return to. Helena, fearing a time paradox and unwilling to give up on him, knocks Indy unconscious.
Back in the present, a recovering Indy awakens in his apartment. Helena, Teddy, Sallah, and Marion are there as well. After everyone else leaves, Indy and Marion reconcile.

150,"Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken","In the seaside town of Oceanside, 16-year-old[8][9] Ruby Gillman lives with her family, trying to fit in with humans despite being krakens. Her mother, Agatha, forbids her from going to prom because of its location being on a ship in the ocean. At Oceanside High School, Ruby initially refuses, but her friends Margot, Trevin, and Bliss convince her to ask out her crush, Connor. Before she can ask, she accidentally knocks Connor into the water. Ruby jumps in and saves him, but Connor believes he was saved by the new girl, Chelsea Van Der Zee, who tries to befriend Ruby. Ruby notices bioluminescent suction cups on her fingers and hides in the library. She attempts to call Agatha, but decides against it. To her confusion and horror, she transforms into a giant kraken and accidentally destroys the library after being startled by the librarian.
Ruby panics after being spotted by Chelsea and runs to the lighthouse to hide. Agatha notices and chases her, reuniting with her brother Brill along the way, who had been sent to retrieve Ruby by her grandmother after she sensed the Pulse emitted by Ruby’s transformation. Finally catching up with her, Agatha calms the distressed Ruby down and she shrinks down to her normal size. At the house, Arthur, Ruby's father, and Sam, Ruby's little brother, discover Ruby's transformation. Agatha explains how Ruby’s earlier mishap triggered the transformation and that she also turns into a giant kraken.
Angered that Agatha withheld the truth from her, Ruby sneaks out to meet her grandmother, the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas, with a reluctant Brill's help. Grandmamah reveals to Ruby that she is a princess and next in line to take the throne, to her shock. She also explains that mermaids are actually the most malevolent creatures in the seas, contrary to popular belief, and that they found a powerful trident called The Trident of Oceanus to rule the ocean, and how her mother, the greatest Kraken warrior, trapped them for all eternity. Ruby declines the throne but is thankful to have finally learned the truth. On her way home, she is attacked and almost killed by an elderly sailor and Oceanside tour guide, Gordon Lighthouse. Chelsea, who reveals she is a mermaid, saves and helps Ruby escape, much to Gordon's disappointment.
Ruby tries to return to her normal life, but footage of her in her Kraken form becomes viral. She has a ""Super Sea Girl Ditch Day"" with Chelsea, who tells her that her mother, the mermaid Queen Nerissa, was supposedly killed trying to retrieve the Trident. She asks Ruby to get it to help unite the Krakens and Mermaids, so Ruby trains with Grandmamah to be powerful enough to get it.
On prom night, Ruby tells her mother about Chelsea, but Agatha, disappointed and outraged that Ruby made friends with a mermaid, forbids her from seeing her grandmother, leading to a frustrated Ruby running back to the ocean to grab the Trident for Chelsea while Agatha confronts Grandmamah, with both realizing that Nerissa never had a daughter and Chelsea is not who she says she is. Ruby succeeds in retrieving it but is betrayed by Chelsea, who reveals that she is Nerissa and uses Ruby to help her reclaim the trident to exact her revenge on the Krakens. Nerissa sheds her disguise and traps Ruby before going to destroy Oceanside. Agatha and Grandmamah try to fight her off while Brill finds a demoralized and wounded Ruby. After he encourages her, she goes to the surface to stop Nerissa. Nerissa overpowers Grandmamah and Agatha but is confronted by Ruby, who engages her in a duel over the trident, revealing her secret to her friends and Connor.
Nerissa gains the upper hand, but Ruby disarms her, realizing that the Trident can be destroyed with enough power. Ruby attempts to reason with Nerissa to no avail, so she, Agatha and Grandmamah combine their laser eyes to destroy the trident, defeating Nerissa and shrinking her to her normal size, where Gordon cages her. Ruby reconciles with her mother, reunites with her friends, and asks Connor out to prom, which he accepts, while Agatha and Grandmamah also reconcile.
Sometime later, everyone returns to their normal lives. The Gillmans become more popular and successful than before. Ruby and Connor become a couple, and she becomes the protector of Oceanside.

151,Nimona (film),"The citizens of a medieval-futuristic kingdom are protected by the Institute for Elite Knights, established by the legendary heroine Gloreth who a thousand years ago, vanquished a ""Great Black Monster"" and enclosed the kingdom with a high wall.
Ballister Boldheart, along with his fellow knight and boyfriend, Ambrosius Goldenloin, is about to be knighted. Ballister is the first commoner to become a knight, as Queen Valerin is trying to change tradition so that ""anyone can be a hero"". During the ceremony, a laser shot from Ballister's sword kills Valerin. A distraught Ambrosius ends up cutting off Ballister's right arm, and Ballister becomes a fugitive. As Ballister hides and crafts a prosthetic replacement arm, he is visited by a shapeshifter named Nimona, who has faced persecution for her powers. Seeing a ""villainous spirit"" in Ballister, as he is facing similar treatment for his commoner origin and the murder of the Queen, Nimona declares herself to be his sidekick.
To clear Ballister's name, the duo kidnaps Diego, the squire who gave him the sword. Diego gives them video evidence revealing that the Director of the Institute is the murderer. The duo confronts Ambrosius and the Director with the evidence, but the Director manipulates her knights into destroying the evidence. Later, Ambrosius confronts the Director, who stabs him and admits that she framed Ballister and murdered the Queen, as she objected to the Queen revising tradition by allowing commoners to become knights, fearing that doing so would lead to the kingdom's downfall. However, ""Ambrosius"" turns out to be a disguised Nimona. Ballister records the Director's confession, then posts it online, leading to public outcry.
The Director discovers through ancient scrolls that Nimona is the Great Black Monster defeated by Gloreth. She uses this to convince the public that Ballister used Nimona's powers to fake the confession. The real Ambrosius meets with Ballister and reveals Nimona's past, insisting that Nimona deliberately deceived Ballister. Shocked by the revelation, Ballister argues with Nimona and questions their friendship; feeling betrayed, Nimona flees into the woods.
Stopping at an old abandoned well, Nimona reminisces about her past: a thousand years ago, she wandered the world and turned into other animals to try and fit in with the wildlife, but none of the creatures she encountered accepted her. One day, she encountered Gloreth as a child by the well, and turned into a human for the first time. After seeing Nimona, Gloreth immediately welcomed her and the two became best friends, and Gloreth was accepting of Nimona's powers. However, the other citizens of Gloreth's village, including Gloreth's parents, believed Nimona was a monster after discovering her shapeshifting abilities. The villagers attacked Nimona with torches, which accidentally set the village on fire. A confused Gloreth became hostile toward Nimona.
With Ballister's abandonment and Gloreth's betrayal echoing in her head, a distraught Nimona transforms into the Great Black Monster. She then enters the city, intending to commit suicide by impaling herself on the sword of Gloreth's statue. However, before she can do so, Ballister stops her and apologizes to her, causing Nimona to change back to human form as they embrace and make amends. The kingdom's citizens see this and are moved by it. Meanwhile, the Director, unmoved, orders a laser cannon to be fired from the wall to kill Nimona; Ambrosius protests, knowing that firing the laser into the city will kill innocent civilians. The Director then turns on them using the same laser she used to kill the Queen and prepares to fire the cannon herself. To save the kingdom, Nimona assumes a giant, red phoenix-like form and flies into the cannon, resulting in her apparent death, as well as the death of the Director. The resulting explosion destroys part of the wall, revealing a beautiful, mountainous valley behind it.
Sometime later, the kingdom undergoes several changes: the breach in the wall has become a passageway through which citizens travel freely, Nimona and Ballister are honored as heroes, and Ballister's relationship with Ambrosius has been restored. Ballister visits his old hideout. He hears Nimona's voice, and joyfully realizes that she has survived.

155,Sound of Freedom (film),"In 2013, Roberto Aguilar, a poor father of two from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is approached by a former beauty queen, Giselle. She offers to sign his young children, Rocío and Miguel Aguilar, to child modeling contracts. He accepts and takes them to the photoshoot. When he returns to pick his children up, they are gone. It is revealed that the children have been abducted and sold to be used as sex slaves.
In Calexico, California, Tim Ballard is a Special Agent for the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where he arrests people who possess and distribute child pornography. The painful work takes a great toll on his personal life, and this is only worsened when another agent, Chris, points out that despite arresting and prosecuting numerous child predators, they are largely unable to prevent more children from being exploited. Tim knows that this is because most of them are outside the U.S., but Chris's words stick with him. He speaks to a suspect he arrested, Ernst Oshinsky, deceiving the man into believing he is a pedophile himself. Once he gains Oshinsky's trust, he sets up a meeting with a trafficked child, and is able to arrest Earl Buchanan, the man who purchased Miguel.
Tim rescues Miguel and asks him for information that would help him find other missing children. Tim learns that Miguel's sister Rocío is still missing, and the boy asks him to save her. Tim arranges for Miguel to return home to Roberto, but not before Miguel gives Tim his sister's Saint Timothy necklace. Tim starts looking for Rocío, and his search leads him to Cartagena, Colombia. He meets with Vampiro (""Vampire""), a former Cali Cartel accountant who now works to save children from sex trafficking, and gains information on Giselle.
After reading about a child sex club in Thailand that was shut down, Tim decides that this is the perfect cover story to acquire a large number of Giselle's children in a sting operation. Vampiro gets a Colombian police officer, Jorge, and a wealthy citizen named Paulo Delgado to help with Tim's mission. Tim's supervisor, Frost, orders Tim to return to the U.S. as he does not have the authority to conduct such an operation on foreign soil. Tim resigns his position rather than abandon the search for Rocío.
Sympathizing with Tim's decision, Frost secretly persuades the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Colombia to assist him however they can. With Jorge acting as a middleman, Tim and Vampiro pose as sex traffickers and convince Giselle to sell them 54 children, enabling the police to identify and arrest her while dismantling her operation. Rocío is not among the freed youths.
After interrogating one of Giselle's associates, Jorge learns that Rocío was sold to FARC, entrenched deep in the Amazon natural region. Jorge informs Tim that there is no way to retrieve the girl, because the region is largely unmapped jungle wilderness, and any rebel territory is a no-fly zone for the Colombian government. Vampiro notes that medical personnel are allowed to enter on humanitarian grounds, and Jorge reluctantly agrees to help them obtain documentation to pose as doctors. The rebels refuse to let Vampiro enter, and Tim is forced to continue by himself.
Tim gains access to the FARC camp where Rocío is being held and learns that she is the personal sex slave for a FARC leader, El Alacrán (""The Scorpion""), and along with others is required to mash coca leaves to produce cocaine. Tim is forced to kill El Alacrán while freeing Rocío, and despite the rebels pursuing and firing on them, gets her to safety. Before they part, he gives her back the necklace Miguel gave him earlier. Rocío is finally returned to her father and brother, and the family goes home to Honduras.
An epilogue states that Tim Ballard testified before the United States Congress and claims that his testimony resulted in laws being passed that require the government to cooperate with foreign countries on sex trafficking investigations. The epilogue also claims that there are more people enslaved today than at any other time in history, including when slavery was legal.

156,Insidious: The Red Door,"In 2019, nine years after his possession, Josh Lambert's memories of his experience in The Further have been repressed. He is divorced from his wife Renai and his mother Lorraine has recently died. His relationship with his son Dalton has become strained, and he attempts to heal things between them while dropping him off at college but it ends with them in an argument.
In his first art class, Dalton ends up drawing a picture of the red door used to enter The Further. Meanwhile, Josh begins being haunted by the spirit of a man, eventually discovering that it is his father Ben Burton who he believed abandoned his family when he was young. Dalton attends a frat party with his roommate Chris, where he sees the ghost of a student that is constantly vomiting. After accidentally going into The Further again, Chris shows Dalton a YouTube video by Specs and Tucker, explaining how astral projection works, which leads to a clip of Elise Rainier talking about The Further.
Dalton attempts to astral project again while Chris watches over his body. Chris is then attacked by an unseen entity and her screams alert Dalton, who rushes back to his body and sees that it is the red-faced demon that tormented him as a child. After being warned by Chris to stop using his abilities, Dalton receives a call from his brother Foster who tells about a recurring dream he used to have of Josh trying to kill them. This spurs Dalton's memory and he finishes his painting, which shows a possessed Josh in front of the red door. A distressed Dalton is pulled into The Further, back to when a possessed Josh attacked them in the basement. He tackles Josh as Josh attempts to kill the younger Dalton and ends up transported back to the red-faced demons lair.
Josh begins researching his father and discovers that he killed himself while institutionalized in a mental hospital. He talks to Renai, who reveals the truth about what happened to their family a decade ago and that his father also had the ability to astral project but believed the things he saw were a result of mental illness. Foster shows them a photo of Dalton's painting he texted and they realize Dalton is in danger. Renai helps Josh to go back into The Further to rescue their son.
With Dalton trapped in his lair, the demon possesses his body and attempts to kill Chris but is stopped when Josh manages to find and free Dalton. The demon chases them to the red door and Josh stays behind to keep it shut so Dalton will be safe. Dalton returns to his body and paints over his red door painting with black paint, which in turns seals the real door and The Further.
Josh meets his father's spirit, who guides him back to the living world. Once back, Josh agrees to have dinner with Renai and the kids, hinting at a possible reunion. As he leaves, he unknowingly meets Elise's spirit, who tells him that he has a bright future ahead of him. Josh then drives to Dalton's college, where father and son reconcile as Dalton reveals a painting of Josh carrying a young Dalton out of The Further.
In a post credits scene, the light over the sealed door to the Further flickers back on.

158,The Out-Laws (film),"Owen Browning, a young bank manager, and Parker McDermott, a yoga instructor, are about to get married. When Parker's estranged parents contact her to come to the wedding, Owen is excited that he will get to meet them, but she is concerned they can be overbearing.
Owen calls Neil and Margie, his difficult parents, to relay the good news about Parker's parents attending the wedding. They show their ignorance of Parker's profession as a yoga instructor, believing it involves a stripper pole, and rather than being happy about the news, they criticize Parker's parents for being absent in her life.
At the bank, Owen has to free an employee locked in the vault as the result of a prank. In doing so, he shows and talks about how state-of-the-art their bank's security system is. They point out their rival bank's vault security is considered the best in the state. Owen also points out all vaults have an emergency escape latch.
Out at dinner with his parents, they talk about the impending arrival of Parker's parents. Meanwhile, Owen talks with the storage space facility where they rent, as he's hoping to access photos of Parker for a wedding photo montage. His call inadvertently alerts Rehan, a crime boss, to their return.
The following night, Parker's parents scare Owen when they let themselves into the soon-to-be-married couple's home, while Parker is still out leading a yoga class. They insist Owen calls them Billy and Lilly. The next day, Owen takes a day off work to spend with the in-laws. They pick the agenda, so they go skydiving, get tattoos, and drink.
Within 12 hours, an infamous full-costumed pair of criminals called the ""Ghost Bandits"" hold up Owen's bank, with Owen, now hungover, in the building. Owen notices specific indicators such as the male's cologne, giving him flashbacks to the bar the night before. He also recalls security details he told Lilly, prompting him to believe that the robbers might be his future in-laws.
FBI special agent Roger Oldham questions Owen as the bank manager, with Billy and Lilly behind him. Not able to say anything, Parker insists they leave once Owen breaks out in tears. Oldham has dedicated most of his career chasing the Ghost Bandits and he's convinced they are behind the robbery.
Trying to enlist his parents' help in outing Billy and Lilly, Owen tells them his suspicions. They do ask direct and inappropriate questions at dinner, but Billy and Lilly expertly redirect the conversation. Parker later asks Owen why he is acting strangely, and while he tells her of his theory, she believes it is crazy.
Owen follows his in-laws to Rehan's and hears Rehan threaten to kill Parker if they don't get her $5,000,000 more before the wedding. Oldham stops Owen on the highway, finds planted evidence in the trunk, and spills it on his in-laws. Oldham puts a wire on him, hoping to get Billy and Lilly to confess. Instead, Rehan shows up with her henchmen and takes Parker hostage as insurance. Disgusted, Owen joins forces with Billy and Lilly.
They first choose Victory Union Bank to rob, but after losing most of the cash they focus on the much bigger Atlas Reserve. Owen asks its manager, Phoebe, how he can better equip his bank, and she arrogantly shows him all of the safeguards. Just as the vault opens, Billy and Lilly create a diversion out front, while Owen locks himself in the vault and then uses the emergency escape latch to escape with the money.
At the ransom drop, Rehan is pleasantly surprised that Owen brought the money, but will kill them anyway. Owen miraculously guns them down as Billy and Lilly distract the cops, so Owen can sneak back into the vault with the money.
Finally as Billy and Lilly turn themselves in, agent Oldham lets them go briefly to Owen and Parker's wedding reception.
During the credits, Owen slips a paperclip into a piece of cake for Billy and Lilly to use to get free of their handcuffs.

Billy feels responsible for causing the apocalypse, and the two live in a dome built by Ray that protects them from the outside environment. They maintain a fishpond, but become distressed when the last remaining female fish dies, leaving behind only two male fish, one of which appears to be dying. Ray stays up late one night, and discovers the possibility that the fish are undergoing sequential hermaphroditism to continue breeding, and notices a bright green light outside the dome. The next morning, Ray tells Billy about his discovery, and Billy realizes that he is also undergoing sequential hermaphroditism and is gradually developing female sex organs.
Billy is distraught over the changes to his body, and Ray is excited to study what is happening. Ray begins feeling uncomfortable around Billy after he becomes aroused when he touches Billy's breast. After the fish begin breeding, Billy reveals to Ray that he has begun to menstruate, and suggests that they try to have a child together. Ray rejects Billy, and refuses to speak to him. Ray admits to Billy that he is hesitant to procreate because he was raised with homophobic values, despite his efforts to be more progressive. Ray and Billy decide to have sex to try and impregnate Billy, initially with a sheet over Billy's body, which Ray eventually pulls off, and the two kiss. Billy becomes pregnant, and the two become much closer.
A big storm hits the dome and breaks the windows, forcing Ray and Billy to break apart the fishpond to patch the broken panes. The next morning, the two are amazed to see some aurora borealis, indicating the sky is becoming less cloudy. Ray is distraught, as their supply of food is ending with the dead fish. Billy, using a story from Ray's eighth birthday, tells Ray to keep hope.

161,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,"A next-generation Russian stealth submarine Sevastopol employs an advanced AI, activated by a two-piece cruciform key. The AI deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert and successfully retrieves a key piece from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. He also fakes her death to ensure she survives a bounty placed by an unknown source. Back in Washington, D.C., he infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger discussing the AI, known as the ""Entity"". CIA director Eugene Kittridge states the Entity achieved sentience and can manipulate cyberspace, allowing it to control global defense intelligence and financial networks. World powers compete to obtain the cruciform key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown.
Revealing himself, Ethan converses with Kittridge and deduces he placed Ilsa's bounty and states his intention to destroy the Entity, knowing they would be considered rogue actors and are participating in a global race. Ethan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the holder of the other key piece while evading US agents. During the pursuit, the key piece is stolen by a professional thief named Grace, while Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device. Ethan suspects foul play after seeing Gabriel, a sadistic Entity liaison with ties to his pre-IMF past. Aborting the mission, the team scatters and Grace escapes to Rome. She is apprehended upon arrival but Ethan rescues her from local authorities, US agents, and an Entity operative named Paris. Grace escapes again, while Ethan rendezvous with Luther, Benji, with Ilsa rejoining them. With Benji and Luther providing support, Ethan and Ilsa follow Grace to Venice where they infiltrate a party held by the arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis.
With the party masquerading as a brokerage set up by the Entity, all groups disclose their role in acquiring the complete key. Grace was hired by Alanna to steal the other key piece to produce the completed key, which will be sold to her buyer the next day on the Orient Express. Through the Entity, Gabriel proclaims he will possess the completed key the next day and that either Ilsa or Grace will die. Ethan unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Alanna from the sale, allowing Gabriel and Grace to escape. Ethan pursues Grace, but the Entity hacks into their communications and impersonates Benji, leading him into a fight with Paris, whom he spares. Concurrently, Gabriel incapacitates Grace and kills Ilsa, devastating Ethan, who vows revenge. Thus, Grace agrees to impersonate Alanna and take the key during the sale. Luther leaves for an off-grid location to prevent interference from the Entity, advising Ethan to spare Gabriel to determine information about the Entity. On the train, Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. With Paris, Gabriel meets Denlinger, who divulges information only he knows in an attempt to form an alliance between himself and the Entity.
Originally an advanced cyber weapon developed by the US, the Entity went rogue following its deployment against the Sevastopol. The completed key unlocks a chamber inside the vessel containing the Entity's source code, allowing it to be destroyed or controlled. Gabriel subsequently kills Denlinger and tries to kill Paris as the Entity determined she would betray them after Ethan spared her life. Impersonating Alanna, Grace brings the key to Kittridge, revealed to be the buyer, and negotiates a $100 million sale alongside protection for herself, but pickpockets the key from Kittridge after cancelling the transfer. Ethan parachutes into the train to save Grace, but Gabriel acquires the key. Ethan and Gabriel fight atop the train, but Gabriel escapes and detonates a bridge ahead. Grace and Ethan detach the locomotive from the rest of the train, saving the passengers. Paris rescues both from falling and manages to tell Ethan the key's connection to the Sevastopol before losing consciousness. Grace informs Kittridge of her desire to join the IMF. Ethan flees the wreckage by paraglider with the completed key, which he took from Gabriel during the fight, and rendezvous with Benji to continue the mission of finding the Sevastopol and destroying the Entity.

162,They Cloned Tyrone,"Fontaine is a drug dealer in a suburban neighborhood called the Glen with odds against him and a schedule he keeps daily. His mother stays in her room all day and rarely speaks to Fontaine, and he still mourns the death of his younger brother. Slick Charles, one of Fontaine's customers, initiates a fight with one of his many sex workers, Yo-Yo. Fontaine goes to confront Slick Charles who owes Fontaine money and encounters Yo-Yo on the way. Fontaine is able to get some of the money from Slick but is then fatally shot by an opposing drug dealer named Isaac as he leaves.
The next morning, Slick is shocked when Fontaine shows up for the money once again, somehow alive and without any recollections of the previous night's events. The two find Yo-Yo to confirm Slick's claims of his death, which confuses Fontaine. He remembers a man, bleeding from a gunshot, was kidnapped by a black SUV, which is now parked outside of a trap house. Fontaine goes inside the house to investigate with Slick and Yo-Yo.
They discover an elevator leading to an underground lab. Inside, a white scientist with an afro tells them that the operation has gone widespread. Slick snorts a mysterious white substance he thinks is cocaine, but ends up laughing and accidentally killing the scientist after Yo-Yo causes a small explosion. Before they leave, the trio discovers a corpse lying on a table, identical to Fontaine.
The next morning, Fontaine breaks into the house again, only to find that the entrance to the lab has disappeared. At a fried chicken restaurant, the diners are giddy with laughter, which makes Slick realize that the fried chicken contains the same substance that he consumed previously. Yo-Yo seduces the restaurant manager, who looks similar to the scientist Slick killed. She discovers that the entirety of the Glen is being surveilled and recorded. They discover that the substance is also being used in grape drinks and hair products. Through some hidden messages from an alcoholic Fontaine encounters daily, they discover a Black church where the group becomes unsettled by lyrics that the churchgoers sing, as a result of the grape drink's influence. After the service, the group discovers an elevator in the altar.
They discover that the lab facility spans the entire Glen area and witness Black people being subject to disturbing behavioral experiments. They find that the lab has clones of many but not all Glen residents, including Fontaine and Slick Charles. They watch the predominantly white, male scientists control the clones through songs and visual stimulation. They exit through a strip club after Fontaine sets off an alarm. The DJ brainwashes the clubgoers with a song and then forces them to chase the trio. A white man named Nixon and a Fontaine clone named Chester show up to halt the clubgoers.
Nixon reveals that scientists conduct experiments on impoverished, predominantly Black populations, including the Glen, to allow the operation to go unnoticed and supposedly achieve peace in America. Nixon uses a trigger word, causing the entire crowd to follow his commands with the exception of Yo-Yo. Nixon tells Fontaine to put a pistol in his mouth, which he does. Yo-Yo pleads for her life, and Nixon uses another trigger word to release them from their hypnotic state. The entire crowd was conscious the entire time, unable to control their actions. Despite the fact that Yo-Yo was a witness who was unaffected, Nixon still threatens to use it on the crowd again if they don't stop their investigation.
Fontaine falls deeper into a state of despair after discovering that his mother, whom he had never actually seen, was just a voice on a tape recorder. Yo-Yo decides to take matters into her own hands, but has her identity exposed and is kidnapped by Nixon. Fontaine comes up with a plan with Slick and Isaac to rescue Yo-Yo, faking his death to sneak into the lab undetected. Fontaine lets Slick and Isaac in to storm the lab with numerous residents of the Glen. They free the Black people being experimented on, including the clones, while Yo-Yo frees herself and finds Slick.
Fontaine is overpowered by Chester and taken to an older version of Fontaine, revealed to be the original Fontaine. He explains that he is helping scientists to create ""peace"" by whitewashing Black people into White people, through mind control and generational breeding. The racially-motivated murder of Fontaine's little brother by a police officer prompted him to start making the clones. After the elder Fontaine claims that the country would be better with assimilation than annihilation, Fontaine uses Nixon's trigger word on Chester and has him shoot the original. Meanwhile, Yo-Yo stalls Nixon from killing her before Slick shoots him in the head.
The facility entrance to the church opens, spilling naked clones out to the public and exposing the country's secret operation. After Yo-Yo announces her retirement from her job, the trio decides to head to Memphis, to further expose and stop the operation.
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a man named Tyrone is identical to Fontaine and living the same lifestyle as Fontaine. With his friends, he watches as one of Fontaine's clones appears on TV.

163,Theater Camp,"Joan Rubinsky is the co-founder and director of AdirondACTS, a theater-focused summer camp in the Adirondacks in Upstate New York. While attending a show featuring one of her campers, a strobe light causes Joan to experience a seizure and slip into a coma. In her absence, Joan's son Troy, a professional ""business influencer"", inherits ownership of AdirondACTS but finds that his personality clashes with those of the theater kids. He makes various attempts to alleviate the camp's financial difficulties, including turning his cabin into an Airbnb, which he shares with guest Tim. He is assisted by Joan's staff, including Amos and Rebecca-Diane, two best friends who are also former campers and longtime staff members.
Amos and Rebecca-Diane announce the summer's slate of productions, including Joan, Still, a new original musical based on Joan's life story, which they have yet to write. During auditions, Troy is approached by Caroline, a representative of investment firm Barnswell Capital, which operates the luxurious neighboring Camp Lakeside. Barnswell offers to purchase the property after revealing to the unaware Troy that the camp is facing foreclosure.
Amos and Rebecca-Diane make progress on Joan, Still, with Rebecca-Diane promising to compose the lyrics and music for the show's finale. Meanwhile, Troy and the camp's chief technician, Glenn, attempt to raise money by having the kids act as servers during a Rotary Club event, with mixed results. As the production continues, Amos is troubled by Rebecca-Diane's continued absences, including disappearing from classes, missing her ""performance night"" for the campers, and failing to show up to rehearsals. Caroline winds up sleeping with Troy, who accidentally signs a contract to sell the camp.
With days remaining before the show, Amos presses Rebecca-Diane to unveil the closing number, which she has not completed. She instead performs an improvised number, sparking an argument between her and Amos. She reveals that she has been absent because she has been hired as a cruise ship performer; the revelation infuriates Amos, who resents feeling left behind in their partnership and refuses to listen to Rebecca-Diane's concerns that her career prospects are fading away. In the midst of their fight, Caroline arrives at the rehearsal, forcing Troy to reveal that the camp could be shut down.
Realizing that the sale will only take place if the bank forecloses on AdirondACTS, Troy invites the ""Founding Ballers"", a group of popular financial influencers, to the performance of Joan, Still, hoping to get much-needed investments. The play is thrown into jeopardy when Darla, the lead, suddenly departs for a prime movie role, but she is replaced by Glenn, who seizes the opportunity to finally show off his talent. At the end of the show, the cast performs a completed version of Rebecca-Diane's closing number and shares what they have learned from attending camp. Amos and Rebecca-Diane reconcile, with Amos deciding to remain at AdirondACTS and giving Rebecca-Diane his blessing to leave.
Although the Founding Ballers enjoy the show, they are revealed to be financially insolvent; instead, AdirondACTS is rescued from foreclosure by a significant donation from Tim, who related to the show's themes. Rebecca-Diane finds success with her cruise ship gig until she accidentally burns down the vessel trying to conduct a séance, while Glenn departs the camp to play Elphaba in Wicked at a Saratoga Springs theater. Amos dedicates himself to teaching, and Troy takes on his mother's work raising money for the camp. When the show finishes, a random hospital patient who was watching the show from a live stream praises the show, as Troy was planning to show it his mother on the live stream but accidentally set it up in the wrong room. Joan awakens from her coma after the show finishes, with her first words being: ""Don't let Troy run the camp!""

Mattel attempts to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help, and the three travel to Barbieland with Mattel executives in pursuit.
Meanwhile, Ken learns about patriarchy and feels respected for the first time. Returning to Barbieland before Barbie does, he persuades the other Kens to take over, and the Barbies are indoctrinated into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and fails to convince everyone to return to the way things were. She becomes depressed, but Gloria gives her a speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, restoring Barbie's self-confidence.
With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria's speech deprograms the Barbies from their indoctrination. They then manipulate the Kens into fighting among themselves, distracting them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland's constitution, and the Barbies regain power. Having now experienced systemic oppression for themselves, the Barbies resolve to rectify the faults of their previous society, emphasizing better treatment of the Kens and all outcasts.
Barbie and Ken apologize to each other, acknowledging their mistakes. Ken bemoans his lack of purpose without Barbie, so she encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who remains unsure of her own identity, meets with the spirit of Ruth Handler, Mattel co-founder and creator of the Barbie doll, who explains that Barbie's story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history surpasses her roots.
Barbie decides to become human and return to the real world and is bidden goodbye by the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband, and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name ""Barbara Handler"", to her first gynecologist appointment.

165,Oppenheimer (film),"In 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in the University of Cambridge. Upset with Blackett's attitude, Oppenheimer leaves him a poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Göttingen instead.
Oppenheimer completes his PhD there and meets fellow scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine ""Kitty"" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled communist who later dies in an apparent suicide.
In December 1938, nuclear fission is discovered, which Oppenheimer realizes could be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer as director of the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is mainly concerned that the German nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis.
He assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe and Edward Teller at the Los Alamos Laboratory, and also collaborating with scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that would ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world. After consulting with Albert Einstein, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are acceptably low. Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.
Following Adolf Hitler's death in 1945, some Project scientists question the bomb's relevance through the Szilárd petition; Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and says it induced Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities. He later meets Truman, and after expressing his personal guilt, Truman berates Oppenheimer as he considers himself responsible for the decision to use the bomb. Oppenheimer urges restricting further nuclear weapons development, which Truman dismisses.
As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for having publicly humiliated him by dismissing his concerns about exporting radioisotopes and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after they successfully detonated their own bomb. He also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.
In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance. However, it becomes clear that the hearing has a predetermined outcome. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are exploited, and Groves' and other associates' testimony is twisted against him. Teller testifies that he lacks confidence in Oppenheimer and recommends revocation. The board revokes Oppenheimer's clearance, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on nuclear policy.
In 1959, during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss' personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer's downfall, resulting in the Senate voting against his nomination. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. A flashback reveals Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation never mentioned Strauss. Oppenheimer instead expressed worries that they had indeed started a chain reaction—a nuclear arms race—that would one day destroy the world.

167,Cobweb (2023 American film),"Peter is a shy, bullied eight-year-old boy living with his overbearing yet emotionally distant parents, Carol and Mark. He earns sympathy from his substitute teacher Miss Devine. Peter wishes to go trick-or-treating on Halloween night, but his parents forbid him due to the disappearance of a young girl several years ago.
Later that night, Peter is woken by the sound of tapping from the inside of a wall in his bedroom. His parents deny these occurrences, insisting that he is imagining them. Over the next few days, Peter talks with a voice coming from the wall. The voice claims that she was trapped in the walls by Peter's parents and calls them ""evil"". Miss Devine becomes concerned after seeing a picture Peter drew of himself scared in bed with the words ""Help me"", and Carol admonishes Peter for bringing his delusions to his teacher. As he is harvesting his pumpkins he dug up what appears to be the skeleton remains of a child. At school, Brian, a bully, destroys Peter's prize pumpkin. Spurred by the voice's advice, Peter pushes Brian down the stairs, breaking his leg. After learning he has been expelled, Peter's parents lock him in the basement, where he discovers a pit covered with a grate.
Miss Devine checks up on Peter but is intimidated and chased away by Mark, who has a gash on his arm. Later, after Peter is released from the basement, the voice explains that she is Peter's older sister Sarah, whom their parents locked away after deciding they did not want her anymore. Carol and Mark had chosen Halloween as the day to imprison her and the girl who went missing years ago had been a trick-or-treater they murdered after she attempted to answer Sarah’s call for help.
She convinces Peter that their parents are planning to kill her and will imprison him in the walls next. His only chance to avoid sharing her fate is to kill them, which he does by slipping rat poison into their dinner and cutting the phone line so they can't call an ambulance. Both parents try to stop him, but are unsuccessful, with Mark succumbing to the poison and Carol accidentally stabbing herself with a kitchen knife after Peter kicks her down the stairs. Right before Carol dies, she warns her son ""Don't let her out"".
Peter unlocks a hidden door behind the grandfather clock in their parents' bedroom. Sarah finally crawls out, revealing herself to be a grotesque, disfigured being. After capturing her brother, Sarah explains that she was born severely deformed, causing her to look like a monster. Terrified by her appearance, their parents locked her away and she was forced to live a wretched, feral existence in the dark. She reveals that she has been manipulating Peter into taking revenge on their parents for locking her away and she was the one who really murdered the girl on Halloween.
Ever since he was born, Sarah has resented Peter for being able to live the normal life she had been denied and wants him dead. Before she can kill him, however, Brian and his cousins show up, planning to take revenge on Peter. But after invading the house, they are all killed by Sarah. Miss Devine arrives and attempts to help Peter escape, but Sarah attacks her and recaptures Peter. As Sarah prepares to finish the duo, Peter manages to subdue Sarah by grabbing her long hair, and they once again imprison the girl in her pit. She warns that she will eventually escape, and will always haunt him.

168,Haunted Mansion (2023 film),"During a New Year's party, Ben Matthias, an astrophysicist developing a camera to detect dark matter, meets ghost tour guide Alyssa and becomes entranced with her belief in the supernatural. Ben marries Alyssa, who dies in a car crash. Distraught, Ben gives up his career and continues to run her ghost tour. Ben searches famous haunted places looking for signs of his wife, but eventually becomes despondent and depressed after finding no evidence of ghosts.
Years later, widowed doctor Gabbie and her son Travis move from New York into Gracey Manor to turn it into a bed and breakfast, only to learn that it is haunted by ghosts.
Ben is visited by exorcist priest Father Kent, who hires him to photograph Gracey Manor's ghosts. Incredulous, Ben returns home and is haunted by a ghost Mariner who forces him to return to the mansion. Ben learns that Gabbie, Travis, and Kent have also fallen victim to hauntings, forcing them to return to the mansion.
Ben and Kent recruit Harriet, a psychic, and steal blueprints to the mansion from haunted house historian Prof. Bruce Davis. The group finds a hidden séance room. Harriet manages to contact the spirit of William Gracey, who writes a message instructing them to talk to the legendary medium Madame Leota. However, before they can continue, an entity forces Harriet out of the house. Bruce arrives later and becomes haunted as well.
The group stays at the mansion and proceed to look for Leota. Ben goes into the attic, runs afoul with the ghostly bride Constance Hatchaway and finds a locked trunk. Examining the contents, they find a crystal ball which houses Leota's spirit.
Leota reveals that William Gracey bought the place and recruited her to try and contact the spirit of his dead wife Eleanor every night for a year, however summoned 999 ghosts into the mansion. An entity then tricked Gracey into taking his own life and trapped Leota inside her crystal ball. Harriet attempts to perform an astral projection for more answers but ends up sending Ben out of his body. He discovers Gracey, including the entity, known as the Hatbox Ghost.
The next morning, Bruce takes Ben to get a sketch artist to draw up the Hatbox Ghost, identifying him as Alistair Crump, a rich heir who was abused by his father after his mother's death and eventually expelled from his family manor. Upon reaching adulthood after his father's mysterious death, he inherited his manor back and threw parties to kill his fellow socialites out of revenge for being shunned by society, before being beheaded by his mutinous servants. Crump's ghost locks the mansion down, but Ben, Kent, and Travis manage to escape. They find Crump Manor, which has become a historical site, and learn from the Mariner, who followed them, that Crump needs someone to willingly die and become the 1,000th spirit in order to escape the mansion. Travis finds Crump's hat, which they can use as part of a ritual to banish Crump back to the afterlife.
The three make it back to Gracey Manor where Ben and Kent, who reveals he is actually a conman, rescue Gabbie, Harriet, and Bruce, but Crump burns the hat. Travis's father is dead, and Crump plans to use the former's grief to make him the willing and final ghost. Ben finds Travis and convinces him to let go of his father as they and Gabbie confront Crump in the graveyard. Kent rallies the ghosts to turn on Crump and join forces with them. Meanwhile, Bruce delivers a piece of the hat to Harriet, who uses Leota's incantation to banish Crump. Crump attempts to get Ben to die willingly to see Alyssa again. However, Ben reveals he has made peace with losing Alyssa before completing the ritual by kicking Crump in the face, sending him back to the underworld.
Many ghosts decide to stay at the mansion, now in harmony with Gabbie and Travis. Ben goes back to teaching and, upon leaving his apartment, pets the cat who has been hanging out by his door, discovering its name is Tater Tot, a nod to his wife's love for the snack. The group reunites on Halloween for a party at the mansion with the happy haunts. Harriet regains confidence in her psychic abilities, Kent becomes a real pastor, Travis is voted to the student council, Gabbie becomes the newest member of New Orleans General and Bruce maintains his newfound friendships.

169,Sympathy for the Devil (2023 film),"David Chamberlain, an expecting father, drives to the hospital where his wife is in labor. On the way there, a stranger gets into the back of his car, simply known as “The Passenger” and tells him to pick a card while holding a gun to his head. David randomly chooses the Ace of Spades which the passenger reveals was in his pocket. He then tells David to drive and, fearing for his life, he does so.
The passenger reveals very little about himself at first, instead mocking David’s attempt to garner sympathy by talking about his family.
Over the course of their road trip, David tries and fails multiple times to get away. First by mouthing “help” to a lady at a gas station who does not get the hint and drives away. Then by speeding so a cop pulls them over but the passenger starts a fight with the cop before asking for Satan to “get behind him”. After that, he shoots the cop several times in the head, threatens David once more, and the trip continues.
The passenger teases David by alluding that he knows him but keeping the truth of where they’re going to himself.
In another escape attempt, David jumps out of the moving car and the passenger struggles to stop before crashing. When David thinks about running away, the passenger answers his phone and discovers the location of David’s wife in the hospital. Knowing she’ll die if he runs, David emerges from hiding, gets back into the car, and they keep going.
They soon stop at a diner to eat where the passenger begins to reveal the true purpose of the kidnapping. He tells David a story about a bookkeeper in Brooklyn who worked for an Irish Mob boss named Jacob Sullivan based in Boston. The bookkeeper fell in love, got married, and had a baby girl. Unfortunately, an associate of Sullivan started stealing money from him and Sullivan told the bookkeeper to invite him over for dinner. He was killed that night and the passenger tells David the same thing will happen to him when they reach their destination.
The passenger gets more and more unhinged the longer they talk. He seems to know David, thinking he’s someone else, and knows he’s lying about his personal life. He demands to know the truth, but David doesn’t know what he’s talking about. After more denial, the passenger snaps, shoots up the diner, and sets it on fire while David calls the cops then runs outside.
In the parking lot, the passenger continues his story. He reveals that he was the bookkeeper and his wife walked in on the murder done by Jacob Sullivan. David and the passenger then fight with the passenger again gaining the upper hand. They return to the car to continue the journey.
The passenger tells David that a man named James Levine called him. Levine was a man who “fixes things” and told him that his wife, being a witness, was a liability. While the passenger was away from home, Levine burned his house down, killing his wife and daughter. The passenger believes that David is, in fact, James, and demands he “say the words out loud”. Dead-eyed, David reveals the truth: “Sullivan ordered the hit.”
David then veers off the road, crashing the car, and fatally wounding the passenger. Cops arrive at the scene as the passenger crawls out but David shoots and kills both of them.
With the passenger dying, David, really James Levine, finally reveals the whole truth about himself: he was responsible for the death of the passenger's wife and daughter. However, the daughter was collateral damage and he feels God punished him for that by “taking” his first born. The passenger listens to the confession, unable to speak as he coughs up blood and weeps, and James presses his forearm to his throat, strangling him to death.
Afterwards, James wipes his fingerprints from the gun and puts it in the passenger's hand to frame him for the cops’ murder. As more cops arrive, James finds the Ace of Spades cards amongst the wreckage and pockets it. Listening to a voicemail, he learns his wife gave birth to a daughter that has his eyes. He smiles, stands, and walks to the cops feigning innocence.

171,Happiness for Beginners,"Divorcée Helen books a beginners' Appalachian Trail survivalist course. While at a party looking for her brother, Duncan, to give him keys to housesit, she speaks to her brother's friend Jake.
When Helen's ex Mike calls, reminding her their sixth wedding anniversary would have been today, she has a flashback. Both Jake and Duncan were at the wedding, disapproving of the very awkward Mike.
Northbound Helen pops in to see Gigi, the grandmother who'd raised them, on her drive from Pittsburgh. Staying in the designated Connecticut motel, the next morning the young guide Beckett gives them an overview of the hiking trip. They introduce themselves and 40ish Helen discovers she's one of the eldest participants, which fellow older hiker Hugh happily points out. Then she is shocked to see Jake appear and introduce himself.
Confronting Jake afterward, as he won't leave, Helen tells him to not interact with her and keep their connection quiet. Shortly after the bus drops the group off at the 50+ mile hike's starting point, Helen immediately gashes her leg on a rock. Jake, a doctor and therefore the designated EMT, dresses her wound and congratulates her on her divorce.
After a short time, Helen gets scolded for stepping on a log, one of many rules they should have learned beforehand. Beckett shows them how to put up a bear hang to protect them and their food. Helen's tentmate Windy is 'crushing on' Jake, but Helen only sees him as immature.
The next morning, Helen asks Jake for help with blisters as she didn't bring the correct footwear and didn't prevent it. Beckett casts some of the blame on Mason, the Wall Street hiker, for not being a team player and pushing everyone.
Windy tries to promote positive thinking. Everyone gets to know each other, Hugh sharing that he had been an aspiring actor but now sells insurance. When they are next alone again, Helen confronts Jake about his staring and hovering. He says he simply fears her returning to Mike, as he's not good enough for her.
As they have been hiking for ten days, Beckett has them rehike a route, grouped according to speed. He insists Mason go with the slower hikers to promote team-building. Before leaving, Beckett has a fit when he finds Helen's personal goal list which had fallen from her pocket. No one fesses up to owning it. Jake, who knows it was hers, quietly calls her out for it, then hands her something to read later.
In Helen's hiking group, they gossip about Jake and Windy, suggesting there is chemistry. A quick kiss is mentioned. While everyone else is checking the map, Hugh foolishly plays balance beam with a rotten log. Severely damaging his leg, as Mason freezes up, Helen steps up and offers to go for help.
Helen explains what happened when she reaches the lead group after nightfall, and they decide to go find them at dawn. Sharing a tent with Jake, she tells him her middle brother Nathan had drowned when she was six. Helen felt responsible, and the family unraveled with first their dad, then their mother, leaving them. They both act jealous: Jake over her accepting Mike's constant messages and Helen over his kiss with Windy, although it was during a game of Truth or Dare.
Waking at dawn, Helen takes the other three to Hugh and company. She and the men carry him on a makeshift stretcher to an awaiting ambulance three miles away. The next day, they all relax and chat and when dusk falls, Helen seeks out Jake who has departed from the group in the woods. Grateful, he hugs her then explains he inherited a degenerative eye disease causing him to slowly lose his sight. It currently affects him most at night and is the reason why he couldn't find the glasses he'd dropped, and also why he'd stopped practicing medicine. They nearly kiss but are interrupted.
The next day they head for the bus, which takes them back to the motel. Meant to participate in karaoke and other farewell activities, Helen ducks out after overhearing that Jake has someone at home. Driving to Gigi's, she can only think of him. Finally reading what he had written her (a poem by Pablo Neruda), she discovers he has feelings for her. Gigi sees the trip has changed her and thinks she might be in love.
Duncan comes over, and Helen apologizes for how she's treated him over the years and vows to be a better sister. Duncan insists Helen go out with him and Gigi to celebrate a birthday. Jake shows up and they finally kiss after he confesses he's loved her for years. The movie ends with a montage of Beckett repeating ""Okay, people"", indicating many new groups of hikers, which he finds his happiness in.

175,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,"Techno Cosmic Research Institute (TCRI) executive Cynthia Utrom sends a squad to hunt down rogue scientist Baxter Stockman, who has created a mutagenic ooze with which he intends to form his own mutant animal family, starting with a housefly. Baxter is interrupted by Cynthia's strike force and killed in the resulting explosion, while the mutagen falls into the sewers of New York City. The mutagen turns four turtle brothers—Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael and Donatello—and a rat named Splinter into humanoid mutants, whereupon Splinter adopts the turtles. Splinter distrusts humanity—particularly after one encounter where he and the turtles were chased away—and trains his sons in the art of ninjutsu, instructing them to only leave their sewer home to steal supplies. Over the years, the Turtles long to live with and like humans their age, much to Splinter's dismay.
Fifteen years later, the Turtles defeat a gang of criminals to recover a stolen moped belonging to a teenager named April O'Neil, revealing themselves and their origins. April, an aspiring journalist struggling to move past a viral incident of vomiting on camera, has been investigating a series of robberies of TCRI technology by a criminal known as ""Superfly"". The Turtles plan to stop Superfly and, through April's reporting, win public acceptance as heroes. They intercept a piece of stolen technology and meet Superfly under the Brooklyn Bridge, discovering that he is not only a mutant himself, but leader of a mutant gang. Ecstatic to meet fellow mutants, the Turtles bond with Superfly and the others and he reveals their creation at the hands of Stockman, explaining that they evaded TCRI and are living on an abandoned ship in Staten Island. He then reveals that he plans to use the stolen technology to mutate every animal on Earth and create a world where mutants have dominance over humans.
The Turtles try to intervene, but the gang escapes with the equipment while a tracker TCRI installed on the equipment falls back with the Turtles, allowing them to be captured. At TCRI headquarters, Cynthia extracts the Turtles' mutagen, but April arrives with Splinter to rescue them. At the gang's hideout, Splinter and the Turtles convince them that their plan for domination will make them no better than the worst of humanity, and together they turn on Superfly, destroying his machine. However, the ooze falls into the water, combining marine wildlife with Superfly, who then transforms into a gigantic whale-like kaiju after grabbing animals from a nearby zoo. He attacks the city and the Turtles and other mutants attempt to stop him but are assumed by the public to be fellow monsters.
Leonardo finds his voice as a leader while April overcomes her anxiety and commandeers a news broadcast to explain the mutants' good intentions and the citizens of New York come to their aid. With the help of the citizens and other mutants, the Turtles drop a canister of TCRI retro-mutagen into Superfly's blowhole, turning him back into a collection of normal animals. Reconciling with Splinter, the Turtles, April, and the mutants are celebrated by the city. The mutants soon move into the sewers with them. Splinter and Scumbug fall in love and the Turtles enroll at April's high school, where they are all embraced as heroes. While the Turtles and April enjoy themselves at prom, they are under surveillance from Cynthia (holding the now unmutated Superfly captive), who plans to recapture the Turtles by enlisting the aid of the mysterious Shredder.

177,Meg 2: The Trench,"Eight years after the events of the first film, Jonas Taylor has been involved in fighting environmental crimes while also helping Mana One in exploring a further deep part of the Mariana Trench where the Megalodon had been found. Following the death of Suyin Zhang, Jonas has been raising her teenage daughter Meiying alongside her uncle and Suyin's brother Jiuming Zhang, who has acquired his father's company alongside wealthy financier Hillary Driscoll. Mana One has also been studying an 80 ft (24 m) female Meg called Haiqi, who was discovered as a pup and trained by Jiuming in a reserve in Hainan. Recently, Haiqi has been acting erratically, leading to Jonas being concerned despite Jiuming's enthusiasm.
Jonas and Jiuming lead a routine submersible exploration to the Trench, with Meiying stowing away to see the trench for the first time. Fellow Meg survivors DJ and Mac observe the group from the Mana One. On their way down, the subs are pursued by Haiqi, who escaped captivity the previous night; the subs dive down through the thermocline to escape, but Haiqi forces her way through it anyway. Two much larger Megs, a massive alpha male and a slightly smaller beta male, appear and mate with Haiqi. While working on an escape plan, Jonas and his team discover an illegal mining operation in a station captained by the mercenary Montes, who has a vendetta against Jonas for his imprisonment some time before. Montes' crew was hired by the secretly corrupt Driscoll to covertly use the Mana One's access to the trench to farm rare earth minerals that could earn them billions. Montes kills his crew in an explosion to cover up their activities, which causes a rupture in the trench and grounds both Jonas’ and Jiuming's ships.
DJ, Mac, and fellow Mana One analyst Jess discover that the rescue pod has been sabotaged, forcing the crew to use exosuits to walk towards the station in the creature-filled trench, with only Jonas, Meiying, Jiuming and security officer Rigas surviving the journey. Jess reveals herself as a traitor and attempts to remotely kill the four, but they escape the station in another submersible after a scuffle with Montes, who escapes to the surface through a buoy. Driscoll sends mercenaries to take over the Mana One while Montes surfaces and meets with Jess. As the crew surfaces, they discover the rupture from earlier which leads to several of the creatures, including the three Megs, a swarm of lizard-like creatures known as Snappers and a giant octopus escaping the trench and reaching the surface.
Jonas’ crew meets with DJ and Mac, and Montes focuses the mercenaries on the crew after Jess is devoured by a Meg. Jonas’ team escapes to a nearby resort, Fun Island, to warn them of the approaching creatures. Driscoll, Montes and the mercenaries arrive at Fun Island to eliminate Jonas’ crew, but they are instead attacked by the Snappers, who devour Driscoll and several mercenaries. Jonas’ group splits up to evacuate the tourists as the Megs and the octopus begin their attack. Jonas manages to kill the beta male Meg using an explosive taped to a harpoon before being attacked by Montes, leading both to sail to the beach. The two battle before Jonas knocks Montes into the mouth of the alpha Meg to be consumed. Jiuming creates a bomb out of fertilizer and along with Mac takes over Driscoll's unattended helicopter to fly towards the beach where Meiying is trying to help tourists.
The octopus takes down the helicopter and Jiuming injures it with his bomb, attracting Haiqi, who engages in a battle with the Octopus and proceeds to kill the beast. As Jiuming swims towards the wreckage to save Mac, Jonas picks up one of the helicopter's rotors and uses it to fatally impale the alpha Meg through the head. Haiqi heads towards Jonas, Jiuming, and Mac, but Jiuming uses his training signals to redirect her attention to a pod of dolphins swimming away. Making their way to the beach, Jiuming reasons that Haiqi escaped captivity because it was mating season, and discusses the possibility that she is pregnant. Jonas decides that it is better not to think about it, and the group celebrate their survival.

Ben talks over the news with his best friend Alice, a 'womanizing' lesbian who flirts with Nina, the waitress at the diner. When Ben calls Miko, now in NYC, he acts dismissively towards her interests. Upset, she says that they should take a break from the relationship.
Ben asks out Autumn and attends one of her performance art shows. When they return to her apartment after the show, he makes a derogatory joke about Autumn’s experimental art, and she rebuffs his attempt to kiss her.
After his failed date with Autumn, Alice invites Ben to a queer house party. She says that she is no longer seeing Nina, as she wanted to enter a serious relationship, and Alice is only interested in casual dating.
At the party, Ben strikes up a conversation with Sasha, a grad student. She visits him at the movie theater and they begin dating. While Ben is excited about Sasha, Alice tells him that she has been suspended from her grad program for kicking Nina’s roommate, who confronted her. Therefore she has decided to travel to New York, upsetting Ben.
Sasha breaks up with Ben a few weeks later. Although she had told him she was single, she was actually on a break with her girlfriend, who has since returned from doing research abroad. At work, Ben announces that the movie theater is closing due to declining ticket sales and seismic issues.
Ben attempts to call Miko but receives no response, and also fails to make progress on a screenplay that he is working on. Alice invites him to NYC, since he has hit “rock bottom.”
There, Ben stays with Alice, who to his surprise is now in a serious relationship with Meredith, a Barnard professor. When he tries to surprise Miko at her internship, he learns from the actual intern that Miko has never worked there. Alice and Ben also discover that Miko has been modeling for Leon, a fashion designer. They stake out Miko’s address and see her holding hands with him.
Upset that Miko is dating a white man, Ben rants to Meredith and Alice and assumes that Leon is an Asian fetishist. In response, Meredith asks him about his own racial preference for white women. Feeling defensive, Ben references Alice kicking Nina’s roommate, causing a fight between Meredith and Alice.
Ben returns to Miko’s address and confronts Miko and Leon in the street. Leon lets them talk privately in the apartment, where Ben tells Miko that Leon is fetishizing her because of her race, based on Leon’s professed interests in East Asian culture. Miko calls out Ben’s own hypocrisy for being angry she’s dating someone else, as her friend saw Ben and Sasha on a date as well. Miko acknowledges she should have told him about Leon, but he needs to look into his own toxic behaviors and that their relationship is over.
Returning to Meredith’s, Ben apologizes to her and Alice for causing their fight and announces that he is leaving the city earlier than planned. While he at first runs towards Miko and Leon’s apartment, he sees the happy couple in a café together, so catches a cab to the airport to return to Berkeley.

182,The Passenger (2023 film),"Randolph ""Randy"" Bradley is a fast food worker in rural Louisiana who is slated to be promoted to manager yet is still bullied by other employees. After Benson, his co-worker, sees Randy being bullied by another employee, he suddenly snaps and shoots all the workers in the building save for Randy. Randy reluctantly helps Benson clean the bloody scene and they place the bodies in the freezer.
The duo drive to a nearby diner, where Randy asks why Benson committed the shooting spree. Benson's response is to insult their waitress, saying that she hasn’t done anything remarkable in her life. Benson takes Randy to Benson's mother's house to give her some food and cigarettes. When Randy goes to get a phone for his mom, Benson pins him against the wall. They go back to Benson's car, where Benson says that he has to hurt Randy to make him learn and sets up a rule that he does only what is necessary for Randy.
They head to a mall to talk to Randy’s ex-girlfriend, Lisa. She explains that the reason for their breakup was because of Randy's apathy and they reconcile. Randy explains to Benson that he had been held back in second grade due to an incident with his teacher, Mrs. Beard, in which he flung an eraser into her eye after being angry, and it ruined their lives; Mrs. Beard was abused by the people in her life, and Randy decided to isolate all of his feelings after the incident for fear of what his emotions can do to others.
Benson and Randy then go to the school where Mrs. Beard worked, to get her home address, whilst Benson plans to kill her. Outside, Benson spots the vice principal. Benson viciously beats him, but Randy stops the attack because of the rule Benson set for Randy.
At Mrs. Beard's house, Randy learns that she does not blame him for the accident. Mrs. Beard answers the phone, and she is told about the vice principal's earlier beating. Benson pulls a gun on Mrs. Beard, but Randy tells that Benson not kill her, at which point Benson takes Mrs. Beard hostage and plans on driving out the city.
The three return to the diner from earlier and while in the restroom, Randy calls the police. They are confronted by the waitress from earlier. Still angered by Benson’s insult, she berates him until he shoots her in the leg. Randy tries to stop Benson, and they hear the sound of police sirens. Angered and terrified, Benson shoots Randy in the shoulder but quickly feels remorse. Saddened by Randy's betrayal, Benson walks outside and commits suicide by cop. Sometime later, Randy plays with Mrs. Beard's daughter as she arrives home and he is finally happy, showing he has control over his own life.

183,The Last Voyage of the Demeter,"On August 6, 1897, the merchant ship Demeter washes ashore in England. Among the wreckage found by the police is the log kept by her captain, Eliot.
One month earlier, the Demeter makes port in Varna, Bulgaria, to pick up cargo for transportation to London. The shipment, consisting of multiple large wooden crates, is transported by locals from Romania. However, the locals refuse to load the cargo onto the ship, insisting that they must leave the area before sundown. One of them hands the quartermaster, Wojchek, and another crewman, Olgaren, a large sum of money and wishes the Demeter a safe voyage before departing with the others.
Clemens, a doctor educated at the University of Cambridge, overhears that the ship is looking for crewmen. He attempts to convince the crew that his medical skills and knowledge of astronomy would make him a valuable asset to them. Wojchek rejects him and hires an older man instead, but while helping to load one of the crates, the new hire – frightened upon recognizing the dragon emblem on its shorter side – accidentally releases the tackle rope, causing the crate to fall. Clemens witnesses the accident and saves Eliot's grandson, Toby, from being crushed by the loose crate. The new hire declares the dragon emblem a bad omen and leaves; out of gratitude for Clemens' intervention, Eliot hires him as a replacement.
One of the crates falls and breaks open in the cargo hold. Clemens investigates and finds a woman buried in dirt inside. She is barely alive, and he performs blood transfusions on her to treat what he believes to be an infection. Later in the Aegean Sea, Clemens and Olgaren see a mysterious figure in the fog on deck.
The next night, all the animals aboard the ship are killed, including the ship's dog, Huckleberry. The crew, fearing a rabies outbreak, throws them all overboard. Anna, the secret stowaway, wakes up and warns them about a monster from Transylvania, a creature that feeds on the blood of humans. In her town they called it Dracula, to whom she was given as a slave of blood so that the monster would leave them alone. She claims that Dracula is already aboard the ship and looking to feed, revealing several bites on her body.
Dracula hunts the crew during the night, biting Olgaren and turning him into a vampiric thrall. Olgaren is temporarily restrained, tied to a table; he breaks free, and, seeing Toby in the hold, begins hunting the boy and traps him in the captain's quarters, along with Dracula. As the crew attempts to save him, Toby is bitten by Dracula. The next morning, the vampiric Olgaren, who had been tied to the mast by the crew, bursts into flames as the sun rises. Despite blood transfusions from his grandfather, Toby dies, and is wrapped in parts of the sailcloth for his sea-burial. During the funeral, the captain believes he sees Toby moving; he unwraps him, only for Toby to suddenly attack. The vampiric Toby catches fire in the sunlight (also severely burning his grandfather) before Clemens is able to throw him into the ocean.
The remaining crew want to destroy the ship and drown Dracula to prevent him from causing chaos once they reach London. Captain Eliot, Abrams, and Wojchek are killed by Dracula, and Anna is bitten during an attempt to save Clemens. Clemens rescues Anna by hitting Dracula with an axe, and Anna manages to crush Dracula with a part of the mast. Anna and Clemens jump ship, thinking the vampire is dead; before sinking, the ship ends up running aground on the British coast, enabling Dracula to push the mast off of his body, roaring in victory.
Anna and Clemens float away on debris, and she reveals to Clemens that she is becoming a vampire after Dracula's bite; Clemens' blood transfusions only delay the change. As the day dawns, and not wanting to become a monster, Anna willingly immolates herself in the sunrise as Clemens drifts ashore.
Arriving in London, Clemens goes to a local tavern where he draws Anna's portrait in his notebook. He hears the knocking signal from the Demeter's crew of ""all clear"", and then sees Dracula, dressed as an aristocrat, laughing at him; the vampire disappears. Leaving the pub, Clemens sees Dracula's shadow and follows him; he vows, for the memory and honour of his dead companions, that he will kill Dracula and send him back to Hell.

184,Heart of Stone (2023 film),"In the Italian Alps at a ski resort/casino, MI6 field agents Parker, Yang, and Bailey, supported by technician Rachel Stone, are tasked with extracting Mulvaney, an arms dealer who is there gambling on a US Navy SEAL combat operation being livestreamed. When Yang is caught trying to sedate Mulvaney, a gunfight breaks out. Parker manages to extract Mulvaney to a cable car while the team heads down the mountain to confront Mulvaney's security.
Stone feigns injury to stay back and contact a mysterious agent named Jack feeding her probability information about how to safely get down the mountain and neutralize the incoming security. She manages to avoid contact with her team, who do not know she is undercover; while extracting Mulvaney, he apparently takes cyanide to commit suicide.
In London, Stone is reprimanded for risking her cover by Nomad, her superior. Concerned by the presence of a hacker she saw in the Alps, Stone discovers she is Keya Dhawan, an orphan with links to Indian criminal syndicates. Stone's organization, ""the Charter"" (which Bailey suspects exists), leaks MI6 Keya's location and sends them to track her down in with Stone still undercover.
Upon arrival, they are ambushed by a squad of mercenaries. Jack orders Stone to evacuate, but she refuses, going back to save the team at the expense of her cover. After they escape, Stone reveals she is a Charter agent.
Parker murders Yang and Bailey, revealing himself as a double agent working with Keya. He admits to covertly murdering Mulvaney as part of his mission to find The Heart, a quantum computer used to guide the Charter's missions. Parker paralyzes Stone with poison before planting a device in her to act as a trojan horse to infiltrate Charter systems. Once she is recovered and taken to Charter HQ, the device begins breaching security. Stone cuts out the device, but the hackers learn the Heart's location and Nomad suspends Stone.
Nomad meets with the other 3 ""Kings"" running the charter, who reveal that Parker was an MI6 agent left for dead during an operation the Charter botched in Chechnya 8 years prior. Having learned from the hack that The Heart's command system is located in an airship over Africa, Parker and Keya fly to the ship. Stone intercepts them, but is unable to stop them from seizing The Heart and destroying the ship. She cuts the rope ladder to their helicopter and she and Keya parachute into the desert.
Keya informs Stone that she biometrically encrypted the Heart, so it is useless without her. A jeep picks them up, taking them to a village, which turns out to be a setup by Parker. Keya is captured and Stone escapes, eventually being rescued by another Charter operative. Stone goes to Iceland, where Parker is using a university supercomputer to exploit the Heart.
Parker uses the Heart to kill the other 3 Charter Kings and several operatives as well as trap the Charter in their bunker without an air supply; Keya becomes disillusioned with him as she intended to use the Heart only for financial gain. She helps Stone avoid an explosion set in a decoy location and reroutes her to Parker and the Heart's true location.
Parker realizes Keya has betrayed him, and tries to force her to unencrypt the Heart. Stone arrives in time to rescue her, and manages to kill him. Keya uses the Heart to restore oxygen to the bunker and turns it back over to the Charter.
Four weeks later, Stone visits Keya in prison and offers her a job in the Charter. They then take on another mission as a new team of Stone, Jack and Keya.

185,"Red, White & Royal Blue (film)","Alex Claremont-Diaz, the first son of the United States, attends the wedding of Prince Phillip of the United Kingdom. Alex has a long-standing feud with Prince Henry, Phillip's younger brother. During the reception, Alex and Henry get into an altercation, resulting in embarrassing reports being published.
To mitigate the fallout and help his mother's re-election campaign, Alex and Henry are forced into a series of interviews and appearances, where they pose as friends. Alex later admits to Henry that he began to resent him after Henry rebuffed him at Alex's first appearance as a public figure. Henry apologizes, explaining he had just lost his father and was forced to go to events, and the two make amends, later beginning to text and become friends.
Invited to Alex's annual New Year's party, Henry leaves abruptly after seeing Alex kiss several girls at midnight. Alex follows him outdoors to the White House grounds. Henry kisses Alex, but fails to respond to Alex's attempts to contact him over the following weeks. After confiding in Nora, his best friend and the Vice President's granddaughter, Alex realizes that he is attracted to Henry.
Weeks later, Alex reunites with Henry and the pair become lovers, although they keep their involvement secret from everyone except for Nora, Henry's sister Beatrice, Henry's best friend Percy, and their ever-present Secret Service and MI5 bodyguards.
When Alex comes up with a plan for his mother to win Texas in the upcoming election, he travels there to lead the campaign. When he goes to Brooklyn to speak at the Democratic National Convention, Henry unexpectedly visits him. Alex later comes out to his mother, who is supportive, but advises him to think about his relationship carefully.
Alex invites Henry to his family's vacation home near Austin, Texas, and Alex begins to tell Henry that he is in love with him, but Henry, fearing that he cannot sustain a love-relationship – since the British royal family will not accept it – pre-emptively leaves the conversation and flees back to England. He refuses to respond to Alex's attempts to contact him. Alex visits Henry in London unexpectedly and demands an explanation for his behavior. Henry admits that he loves Alex too, but explains that his royal position makes it impossible. Alex convinces Henry that their relationship is worth fighting for, and the two reconcile.
Shortly after Alex returns to the U.S., Alex and Henry's personal e‑mails to each other are hacked and posted online, and are being widely reported in the press. Both the White House and the Palace cut off all Henry's and Alex's means of contact. Zahra, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, gets in touch with Shaan, Henry's equerry, and Alex and Henry are finally able to talk. Alex immediately flies to London to reunite with Henry. King James III summons them to a meeting and tells them that they cannot be together since their relationship is incompatible with royal tradition. However, Beatrice notices a crowd gathered in front of Buckingham Palace in support of them, and news reports of similar crowds of supporters in many areas of the U.K. Alex and Henry step outside together onto the balcony and openly greet the public as a couple.
On election night, Henry returns to the United States to be with Alex, whose plan to win Texas for his mother ultimately results in her re-election. Alex and Henry later visit Alex's childhood home in Austin to personally celebrate.

One day, a UFO lands in his backyard and a small humanoid alien crawls out. Milton attempts to get help, calling the police and his daughter, and bringing it up at the city council meeting but is brushed off as senile.
Milton brings the alien, who is nonverbal, inside and treats him as a guest, providing the alien with a tray of assorted food but discovering that his guest only drinks water and eats apples. Sandy, an acquaintance, stops by and discovers the alien, telling Milton that they should keep it a secret for its own safety. Joyce, another elderly woman, also discovers the alien.

After she states that she will call the police, the man tackles and attempts to strangle her; however, the alien (whom they have named Jules) receives a vision of the events and telepathically causes the man's head to explode.

188,Blue Beetle (film),"In the remote tundra of Antarctica, members of Kord Industries, led by the company's co-founder and CEO Victoria Kord, locate an ancient alien artifact known as the Scarab. Meanwhile, Jaime Reyes returns to his hometown of Palmera City after graduating from Gotham Law University, only to learn that his family is facing eviction from their home due to financial difficulties. Jaime's sister Milagro manages to get him a job at Victoria's mansion. However, both are fired after Jaime stops a confrontation between Victoria and her niece Jenny. Jenny later tells Jaime to meet her at Kord Tower the next day to discuss a ""job opportunity"".
The next day, Jenny finds that Victoria is using the Scarab for her One Man Army Corps (OMAC) projects. She steals the Scarab and avoids security by giving it to Jaime, hidden inside a Big Belly Burger to-go box. At home, Jaime's family convinces him to open the Scarab box. When Jaime touches it, the Scarab activates and fuses with him, encasing him in an armored exoskeleton. Jaime later finds Jenny for answers, rescuing her from Victoria's armed forces. She tells Jaime that the Scarab is a sentient weapon and that it has willingly chosen Jaime to be its host. With the help of Jaime's uncle Rudy, Jaime and Jenny break into Kord Tower to retrieve a smartwatch that once belonged to Jenny's father Ted, but are attacked by Victoria's bodyguard Ignacio Carapax, who has an OMAC prototype infused in his body. The Scarab is revealed to be named Khaji-Da. It temporarily takes over Jaime's body and battles Carapax. Rudy and Jenny help incapacitate Carapax, then escape to Jenny's childhood home with Jaime.
Jenny uses Ted's watch to activate his secret laboratory and reveals to Jaime that Ted was originally a vigilante named Blue Beetle who spent his life studying Khaji-Da before mysteriously disappearing, leaving his company in Victoria's hands. When they notice Victoria's helicopter flying toward Jaime's home, Jaime summons Khaji-Da and returns to protect his family. As they escape, however, Jaime's father Alberto collapses and dies from a heart attack, distracting Jaime and allowing Carapax to capture him. Jaime is taken to an island fortress near Cuba, where he is strapped to a machine that downloads information from Khaji-Da to the OMACs. While unconscious, Jaime sees a vision from his father, who encourages him to embrace his destiny as the new Blue Beetle.

Jenny and the Reyes family use Ted's Bugship and its weapons arsenal to storm the island. Jaime reunites with his family, then encounters Carapax and battles him. Jaime nearly kills Carapax before Khaji-Da reveals to Jaime memories of Carapax's enslavement by Victoria for the OMAC experiments, including the death of Carapax's mother at Victoria's hands, leading Jaime to spare him. Carapax turns on Victoria and sets his OMAC suit to explode, destroying the island, himself, and Victoria as vengeance for his mother. As the Reyes family escapes from the island, they take time to mourn Alberto. In the aftermath, Jenny becomes the new CEO of Kord Industries and promises to repair the damage caused to the Reyes family, by helping them rebuild their home. As the neighbors gather around the remains of the Reyes family's home and provide support, Jaime kisses Jenny and then offers to fly her to the Kord Estate. In a mid-credits scene, a distorted recording is broadcast in Ted's laboratory, attempting to inform Jenny that he is alive.

189,Strays (2023 film),"Reggie is a gullible Border Terrier living with his selfish deadbeat owner, Doug. Even though Doug only keeps him to spite an ex-girlfriend, Reggie is under the impression that Doug loves him and does everything he can to make him happy, much to Doug's chagrin.
When Reggie inadvertently destroys Doug's bong, Doug makes several attempts to ditch Reggie, which Reggie views as a game. Losing track of Doug in a city hours away, Reggie meets a street-wise Boston Terrier named Bug who teaches him how to be a stray after he defends him from a Rottweiler and a Doberman. After a night with Bug and his friends, an Australian Shepherd named Maggie and a therapy Great Dane named Hunter, Reggie finally realizes that Doug does not love him. He decides to get revenge by biting Doug's penis off, and the other strays accompany him for support.
During the journey, the group bonds as they get into several situations, culminating in getting caught by Animal Control after a hallucinogenic mushroom-induced high causes them to maul a family of rabbits they mistake for toys to death. During their captivity, Bug admits that he used to have a family of his own but was forced to escape when they tried to euthanize him after he bit their daughter (though he fails to see exactly what he did wrong). In an attempt to escape, the dogs plan to use Hunter's erect penis to hook the kennel keys but are unsuccessful. Then in another attempt to escape, Reggie suggests that every dog defecate on the floor at the same time so when the security guard opens it, they can all run out, in which they are successful. After escaping the pound, however, Reggie convinces himself that he is to blame for Doug treating him poorly. This causes Bug to urinate on Reggie's bandana in a fit of rage and Reggie leaves the group. Making their way back to the city, Bug, Maggie and Hunter stumble upon a lost girl scout and alert a search and rescue worker to her location.
Reggie returns to Doug's house and after reminiscing about all the times Doug mistreated him, finally discovers his true nature. As he confronts and cuts ties with him, Doug prevents Reggie from leaving the house and attempts to murder him. The other strays soon arrive to intervene and, with their help, Reggie successfully rips Doug's penis off. Hunter also defecates in Doug's mouth and during the altercation, Doug's house is inadvertently set ablaze by his bong and his pickup truck is destroyed by a falling utility pole. Afterward, the strays move on: Maggie begins training as a police dog and starts a relationship with Hunter, who returns to being a therapy dog, the girl scout adopts Bug and Reggie remains a stray and chooses to guide new strays, though still spends time with the other dogs often.
In a mid-credit scene, Doug, hospitalized, learns from his doctor that they failed to reattach his penis, much to his horror and ire.

190,The Monkey King (2023 film),"One night, a monkey is born from a stone atop a tall mountain and disturbs the Jade Emperor. He gives the order to eliminate the cub, but Buddha appears before him and tells him to let him find his purpose.
Monkey finds a troop of other monkeys, but his unruly nature keeps him from fitting in. One of his escapades causes a feared demon to pounce from his mountain lair and grab one of the troop's cubs for food; as a result, Monkey is banished. To prove his worth, he trains to fight the demon. After many years, when he deems himself ready, he confronts the demon, but his training proves ineffective, and another cub is snatched. To fetch a more suitable weapon, Monkey dives into the sea realm of the Dragon King, who is about to use a glowing column to eradicate all life on the world's surface. Communicating with the column, Monkey turns it into a staff and escapes.
Monkey returns to the demon's lair, defeats him, and rescues the cub. Prompted by the grateful troop, he crowns himself King of the Monkeys, but the troop's elder cautions that his staff should only be used by the gods, so the new Monkey King decides to kill 100 demons, thus gaining the right to become a god. Eventually, he comes to a village terrorized by the Red Girl. With the endorsement of a girl named Lin, Monkey King defeats Red Girl, but the Dragon King arrives during the victory celebration to reclaim his prized weapon. After fighting him, Monkey King leaves the village; Lin, pledging herself as his assistant, tags along, even though he treats her condescendingly. Unknown to him, Lin is helping the Dragon King reclaim the staff in return for saving her drought-stricken village.
In a graveyard, Monkey King opens a portal to Hell to get to the Archive of Souls and strike his name off his Scroll of Life and Death, thus gaining immortality. King Yama, the ruler and chief judge of Hell, recognizes them as outsiders and fights them. Monkey King succeeds in erasing his name, but is only made ageless. He steals Yama's Book of Everlasting Life and learns he must eat a peach from the Orchard of Everlasting Life to gain full immortality. The Dragon King subtly guides Monkey King and Lin to a peach tree laced with an intoxicating poison, but ends up getting fed one himself, foiling the plan.
After realizing the peaches are fake, Monkey King learns from the book that Wangmu, the divine Queen Mother, brews an immortality elixir for the gods. He and Lin infiltrate the Jade Palace's pharmacy to create a sample of the elixir. Wangmu catches them in the act, but Monkey King consumes the potion, thus becoming fully immortal. Although Lin has several chances to steal the staff, she repeatedly returns to help Monkey King, who also demonstrates that despite his rude behavior, he cares about her too. Monkey King and Lin flee the Heavens, and in a following heart-to-heart, Lin admits that she longs to make a difference in the world and tries encouraging Monkey King to do the same.
When Monkey King remains aloof and boisterous, Lin outwits him and delivers the staff to the Dragon King. The Dragon King reneges on his deal and prepares to drown the world in a mega-storm, but Monkey King challenges and attacks him. Realizing her mistake, Lin enables Monkey King to beat the Dragon King, but Monkey King becomes power-drunk, and Buddha prepares to intervene. Wanting to give Monkey King another chance, Lin is allowed to act as Buddha's voice and challenges Monkey King to leap off Buddha's hand to win rulership over Heaven, or else suffer a period of penance. Monkey King fails and is imprisoned in a mountain. Before the mountain is fully closed off, Lin is allowed to say goodbye to Monkey King, who finally admits how important Lin has become to him. She leaves him his staff for company.
Five hundred years later, Monkey King is freed from his prison by a monk, a pig, and a river spirit at Buddha's behest. They invite him to join them on a journey to the West, to which he over-happily agrees.

Meanwhile, Jann Mardenborough, a teenage clothing store employee and gamer from Cardiff, Wales, is an avid player of the simulator and wants to become a racing driver, despite the disapproval of his former footballer father Steve Mardenborough.
One day, Jann learns he is eligible for a qualification race to join the GT Academy after setting a time record for a particular track. The night before his race, Jann is invited by his brother Coby to a party, and the brothers take their father's car. Jann flirts with a young woman named Audrey whom he develops a crush on. The gathering is disbanded after police arrive, and Jann initiates a pursuit after driving away when their friends are pulled over. The brothers escape but are caught returning by their father. Coby starts to worry, but Jann offers to take the blame for him if he admits that he is the better driver. Jann is taken to his father's place of employment the next morning in an attempt to be taught a life lesson, but leaves early to partake in the qualifying race, which he wins, earning a place in GT Academy.
At the academy camp, Jack puts the competitors through their paces in various tests, through which ten competitors are narrowed down to five. During one of the tests, Jann crashes with Jack in the car and claims that the brakes were glazed. This is later proven correct by analysts, to Jack's surprise. The remaining five compete in a final race to determine who will represent Nissan. Jann narrowly wins the race against American competitor Matty Davis, but Danny insists Matty should be chosen as the representative due to his better commercial viability. However, Jann is chosen at Jack's insistence.
Jann is told that if he finishes at least fourth in any one of a series of qualifying races, he will earn a professional licence and contract with Nissan. He finishes last in his first professional race in Austria after Nicholas taps him into a spin, and despite gradually improving over the next few races, he does not finish the penultimate race in Spain. He travels to Dubai for his last qualifying race, during which Nicholas takes a corner too fast and crashes. Despite the debris from this crash cracking his windshield, Jann achieves a fourth-place finish and earns his license. He then travels to Tokyo with Danny and Jack to sign his contract and uses his signing bonus to fly Audrey to Tokyo. During this time, they initiate a relationship.
Jann's first race after signing is at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. He starts the race well and maintains a high position until the front of his car lifts into the air at the Flugplatz corner, hitting a barrier and launching into a crowded spectator area. Jann is airlifted to the Nürburgring Medical Center and is informed while in hospital that a spectator was killed in the crash, much to his horror. When Jann is reluctant to return to racing and blames himself for the spectator's death, Jack takes him back to the Nürburgring. He reveals that he was involved in a fatal accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which led to a fellow driver dying and subsequently Jack's retirement from driving.
An inquiry clears Jann of any wrongdoing, but professional sentiment begins to turn against sim drivers. In response, Danny decides that a sim driver team needs to compete at Le Mans and finish on the podium to prove their viability.
Danny enlists Matty and fellow GT Academy participant Antonio Cruz to make up the three-driver team alongside Jann. On race day, Jann's father apologizes for not initially being supportive of his passions. Early in the race, Jann is left shaken after Frederik Schulin's car crashes and catches fire, but is encouraged through his first shift by Jack playing ""Songbird"" and ""Orinoco Flow"" through the car's communication system, songs which Jann had previously used as motivational music during training. Matty and Antonio complete their first shifts without issue, but the latter is brought in from his last session early due to experiencing cramps. A wheel nut is dropped by mechanic Felix during the pit stop, causing Jann to lose several positions. Deviating from advised racing lines, he uses instead lines he learned from playing Gran Turismo to regain his position, breaking the competition lap record in the process. The final lap sees Jann pitted against Nicholas, with Jann once again narrowly in front on the final straight to earn third place and a podium finish for Nissan.
In the epilogue, the real Jann Mardenborough is shown having competed in over 200 races and served as his own stunt double in the film.

195,Retribution (2023 film),"Matt Turner works as a financier at Nanite Capital under his friend and CEO Anders Muller and lives with his wife, Heather, and two children, Emily and Zach, in Berlin. While driving his kids to school, Matt receives a call from an unknown number with a distorted voice who says that there is a bomb under his seat, which was already armed when Matt sat on it. The bomb is triggered by both pressure plates placed on all the seats and a radio frequency. He also threatens to detonate the bomb if Matt tries to get help. Matt finds the device and he is forced to follow the bomber’s instructions in order to keep them alive.
The bomber forces Matt to watch Sylvain, the latter’s client who is also receiving a bomb threat, being killed in an explosion when Sylvain’s panicked girlfriend attempts to escape. The bomber tells Matt to call Heather to retrieve €50,000 from his safety deposit box at the bank and deliver it to him. After Heather retrieves it, the bomber changes the plan by telling her to give the money to a man in a blue suit. When she does, the police arrive and arrest the man.
After seeing the news implicating Matt for the bombing, Europol agent Angela Brickmann calls him; Matt tries to convince her of his innocence and requests that cellular signals be jammed to prevent the remote trigger. The bomber reveals that Matt and Anders have a €208 million slush fund from the clients deposited in Matt’s “emergency collateral account” in a bank in Dubai. He arranges for Matt to meet Anders at a power plant. Arriving there, the bomber forces Matt to order Anders to liquidate his collateral account. Despite Anders reluctantly complying, the bomber orders Matt to kill Anders with a revolver in exchange for his life and his children. When Matt refuses, the bomber blows up Anders’s car; the shrapnel injures Emily’s leg.
After a police chase, Matt is eventually surrounded by them with Angela and Heather arriving at the scene. Once they realize that the pressure plate is only located under Matt's seat, the bomb squad safely removes Zach and Emily, who is then treated for her injuries. Interrogating Matt, Angela suspects the bombing might be related to the heist. After talking to Heather for the last time, Matt drives away and evades the police, determined to find the bomber by himself. Matt demands the bomber to meet him in person if he wants the money.
The bomber is revealed to be Anders all along. Anders reveals that he wanted to make Matt a fall guy for the series of bombings to cover up his scheme of embezzling €208 million wired into his crypto account. To end this, Matt deliberately crashes his car, causing it to cling on the side of a bridge. Matt unlocks his seat belt and falls into the river, allowing the bomb to activate and kill Anders. Angela and the police arrive at the scene, with Angela nodding at Matt before allowing him to walk free.
During the credits, the news reports state that the bombings were part of the heist perpetrated by Anders, and Matt cooperates with Europol to resolve the incident.

As on their previous vacation, Ron and Kyla encourage Marcus and Emily to party excessively. The next morning, Marcus discovers that his meeting has been moved up, and the Kim Wae executives are already at the hotel ahead of company owner Mrs. Kim's arrival.
The foursome meet for drinks with Kim Wae executive Yeon, who tells Marcus he is not his first choice for the Chicago project. The event is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Kyla's father Reese, who has just been released from San Quentin State Prison. Reese quickly clashes with Ron, who is unaccustomed to having people dislike him. Reese tells Kyla that he has an investment opportunity for a cryptocurrency called SCOM Coin. Marcus and Emily are immediately dubious, but Emily encourages Marcus to have faith in Reese.
Marcus and Ron take Reese surfing, where they see Reese meet with mysterious stranger Jerome. Marcus and Ron are goaded and Yeon and Reese, respectively, into surfing high waves; Marcus is badly injured after wiping out. At the hotel casino, Marcus forces Ron plays a drinking game, putting Kim Wae executive Minjin in the hospital. Emily is ejected after Kyla gives her card counting tips. Reese meets with drug lord Warren, and makes a deal to recover Warren's downed plane. Warren threatens to kill Reese, but is interrupted by Marcus and Ron's arrival. Later, the two return a drunken Yeon to his hotel room, who endorses Marcus for the project but complains that Mrs. Kim does not value his opinion.
Reese invites the four on a snorkeling expedition as a cover for he and Jerome to retrieve five million dollars in cash from Warren's plane. As they depart, they are chased by authorities for trespassing in Cuban waters. The group manage to escape, but damage to the plane forces them to make a crash landing. Jerome escapes with a bag of money, while the rest is destroyed by the plane exploding. The crash is spotted by Warren and his men, and the five are chased and captured. Reese lies to Warren, telling him that the money was never recovered. Warren's men trap the group in a cargo container while they go to retrieve the money. Ron and Reese begin to argue, but are interrupted as the container is dropped into the water, leaving the group to drown. Ron lights a joint, using the smoke to discover a weak point and break open the container. Kyla hotwires a car to assist the escape.
The group rush back to the hotel, chased by Warren's men, to get Marcus to his meeting. After reaching the hotel, Reese, Marcus, and Ron are held up by Warren's men, but are saved by Maurillio, who impersonates notorious drug kingpin Chencho Novar to negotiate a peace. Warren agrees to release Ron and Marcus, but demands the five million dollars be repaid for Reese's freedom. Ron agrees to pay the ransom, revealing that he took Reese's SCOM Coin tip and made millions from it. Reese is amazed at Ron's generosity and gives him and Kyla his blessing. Marcus rushes to stop a departing Mrs. Kim, but she is unwilling to hear him out after failing to make their meeting. Yeon speaks up on Marcus's behalf, winning him the job. The group celebrates, but the FBI arrives, revealing that Reese was not paroled, but in fact broke out of prison to spend time with Kyla. The rest of the group makes plans for the evening, except for Ron, who plans to attend to ""unfinished business"" - a drinking rematch with Minjin.

198,Bottoms (film),"PJ and Josie are unpopular lesbian best friends at Rockbridge Falls High School who have never had sex. Josie and PJ pine for popular cheerleaders Isabel and Brittany, respectively. At the beginning of their school year, PJ and Josie, joined by their friend Hazel, attend the local fair, where they witness Isabel and her boyfriend Jeff, the quarterback of the Rockbridge Falls Vikings, having an argument. Isabel gets into PJ and Josie's car, and they softly bump Jeff's knees when he refuses to move out of the way. Jeff falls to the ground, feigning severe injury.
When school starts, rumors spread that PJ and Josie were in juvie over the summer and that the girls had physically fought Jeff. When Principal Meyers threatens them with expulsion, Josie lies that they were simply practicing for a feminist ""self-defense club"". PJ and Josie decide to actually set up the self-defense club in the name of female empowerment with Hazel's help, though they secretly want to use it to get attractive girls to have sex with them. They ask Mr. G, a careless and disinterested history teacher currently going through a divorce, to be their advisor since they assume he won't show up for the club meetings, though he does anyway. He attempts to shut the club down after seeing how violent it is, but PJ and Josie manage to convince him that it's about female empowerment and he changes his mind, growing more interested in feminism as a result.
The club grows closer through their chaotic and violent practice, while PJ and Josie continue their lie about having been to juvie. Jeff's overprotective best friend Tim, a fellow Vikings player, suspects that PJ and Josie never went to juvie and calls local juvenile halls to confirm that there was no record of them having gone. Hazel discovers that her mother is having an affair with Jeff. Josie tells Isabel, and Isabel breaks up with Jeff in front of the student body in the cafeteria. The club decide to vandalize Jeff's house with eggs and toilet paper, though Hazel builds a bomb that blows up his car. Tim suspects the club is involved, and all of the club members except for PJ accept that the club will end as Principal Meyers will believe anything Jeff and Tim say. Faced with the club's disbandment, PJ and Hazel bicker, and PJ humiliates Hazel for being a loner. Tim watches from outside and calls out towards Hazel as she storms away crying. The following evening, Josie invites Isabel to her room and they have sex. Meanwhile, PJ kisses Brittany, but Brittany informs her that she is straight.
At the pep rally for the upcoming football game against longtime rival Huntington High School, Tim calls on Hazel to represent the club by fighting the school's top boxer in combat. Hazel manages to hold her own for a while, but ultimately loses the fight and is severely injured. Tim reveals the lies behind PJ and Josie's ""fight club"" and time in juvie, publicly humiliating them in retaliation for taking attention away from the football team and ""injuring"" Jeff. PJ and Josie argue over who was responsible for the club and fall out, and the two are ostracized at school, even being told off by Mr. G, who renounces feminism and goes back to his old chauvinistic ways.
Josie seeks advice from her childhood babysitter Rhodes, who reveals that per tradition, Huntington intends to kill a Rockbridge football player at the upcoming game. Hoping to prevent this, PJ and Josie rekindle their friendship, and then make up with Hazel and the rest of the girls in the club, though they are unable to recruit Isabel and Brittany. They realize Huntington High has tied several large barrels of pineapple juice into the football field's sprinkler system to kill Jeff, who is deathly allergic to pineapple.
Hazel tries to distract the audience by blowing up a tree, but the bomb fails. She and PJ manage to divert everyone's attention by publicly making out. Upon the arrival of Huntington High's team, Isabel and Brittany rejoin the club and a brutal, bloody brawl ensues between the players and the fight club. Josie heroically carries Jeff off the football field to safety and falls on top of him afterwards. Jeff attempts to kiss her, but Josie immediately rebuffs him. The players are beaten by the girls and several of them are killed. The sprinklers go off and Tim tastes the pineapple juice, realizing the plot to murder Jeff and calls to celebrate the club for saving Jeff. Josie and Isabel embrace with a kiss. The tree bomb finally explodes, interrupting the celebration.

199,Golda (film),"In October 1973, the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad receives intelligence implying that Egypt and Syria are preparing to commence a military campaign against Israel, which it promptly relays to the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir. Meir is dismissive of the intelligence, noting her inability to initiate a counter-plan without the support of her defense minister, Moshe Dayan, who is equally skeptical.
On 6 October, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Meir's inner circle informs her that Egypt has amassed a large force opposite the Suez Canal, concluding that hostilities would begin by sundown. Although realizing her tardiness in preparing adequately, Meir refuses to make a pre-emptive move, instead ordering a partial mobilization to face the threat. Nevertheless, she is surprised when the attack begins early. Dayan, who is sent to inspect the Golan Heights on the Syrian border, is horrified to discover that Syria has launched a thorough attack against the ill-prepared Israeli troops. Dazed, he attempts to resign; Meir talks him out of it but loses confidence in him.
Between 7-8 October, with Egypt and Syria making gains into Israel, Israeli Defence Force chief of staff Lieutenant General David Elazar proposes to relieve Israeli fortifications in the Sinai Peninsula using the 162nd Division led by Major General Avraham Adan. Despite opposition from Mossad chief Zvi Zamir, the plan proceeds, but the Egyptians defeat the Israeli force. The next day, with the Syrian offensive having slowed, Dayan proposes an air strike on Syrian capital Damascus to put pressure on Egypt. However, with a shortage of planes, the Israeli Air Force is unable to proceed. In response, Meir asks United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to provide surplus jets, to which he reluctantly agrees, though he expresses that it is problematic for the United States to increase its support for Israel in light of the 1973 oil crisis.
On the fifth day, amidst increasing tensions, Major General Ariel Sharon proposes an operation to cross the Suez Canal using the 143rd Division to challenge the Egyptian Second and Third Armies. Zvi informs Meir that the Egyptian 4th and 21st Divisions would cross the canal in two days, leaving Egyptian capital Cairo undefended in the event of an attack. According to the intelligence, the Egyptians cross the canal, are met with resistance from Israeli tank forces led by Lieutenant General Haim Bar-Lev, and are defeated.
On 15 October, Sharon's forces cross the canal at an undefended point called the ""Chinese Farm"". They are ambushed by Egyptian units but maintain their positions. Meanwhile, Elazar prepares to barricade the Third Army by cutting off Suez from Cairo, which would accordingly force Egypt into negotiations. Concurrently, Kissinger pays a private visit to Meir and urges her to accept a ceasefire. Meir proceeds with her plan anyway, which finally forces Egypt into talks.
By the twentieth day, both sides agree to the further diplomatic talks and to exchange prisoners of war, effectively concluding the conflict. However, Zvi privately informs Meir that military intelligence chief Major General Eli Zeira had neglected to properly monitor signals intelligence from the Egyptian side, which allowed Israel to be attacked unawares. Although appalled, she chooses to bear the blame, rather than reveal the existence of the listening system. Despite the victory, the conflict's intensity inflicts an emotional toll on the aged Meir, who is stricken with cancer.
One year later, in 1974, Meir testifies before the Agranat Commission about her conduct in the war. She states off-the-record that despite her initial uncertainty, she genuinely felt war was certain. Four years later, on 8 October 1978, a bedridden Meir dies watching footage of her meeting with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat a year earlier.
The film's epilogue reveals that the commission cleared Meir of any wrongdoing and that she lived to see the signing of the Camp David Accords, the first formal measures of peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

200,The Hill (2023 film),"In a small town in Texas, a young Rickey Hill wears leg braces due to a degenerative spinal disease, but enjoys playing baseball and is regarded as a batting prodigy. James, his strict father and a pastor, dissuades Rickey from the sport, wanting to shield him from further injuries and urging him to pursue preaching. The family is evicted from their home and forced to move to Oklahoma. When their car breaks down, they are assisted by a family who offers James a position at a local church.
Rickey struggles to adapt to his new home until he encounters a group of children playing baseball. The pitcher harasses him over his disability until he connects on a pitch. He tries to join the local baseball team but is required to have a parent's permission, and his brother Robert decides to forge their father's signature. When James finds out, he lectures both for lying but refrains from beating Robert at the last minute. Rickey finally reassures him that he is capable of both preaching and playing baseball.
A few years later, Rickey is one of the top high school baseball players  but struggles to attract the interest of Major League Baseball scouts. Ray, his boss at his part-time job who watched Rickey bat as a child, invites scout Red Murff to his upcoming game. Rickey plays against the bully from his youth, off whom he hits the go-ahead home run, but trips on a sprinkler while catching the game-winning out. A doctor diagnoses him with a fractured ankle and severed leg tendons, declaring his playing days to be over. Although an effort to fundraise to pay for his treatment fails, Ray provides him with money to help him recover in time for an MLB tryout. James forbids him from taking part and he despondently agrees, to the dismay of his childhood sweetheart Gracie.
Rickey's grandmother falls ill, and she urges James to let Rickey pursue baseball before dying. A motivated Rickey removes the cast from his foot and begins training with Robert.
On the first day of the tryout, Rickey runs drills alongside other prospects in front of scouts including Murff, during which underachieving players are sent off by scouts. He struggles with fielding and baserunning, and a scout tries to dismiss him until he convinces him to let him bat. Most of his hits land near Murff in the adjacent park. The tryout concludes without a word and he dejectedly goes home before returning to retrieve his glove, where he sees a motivational message from James. Rickey returns to the park, where Murff challenges him to be the designated hitter for both teams in the prospects game.
During the game, Murff pressures each pitcher to strike out Rickey, though he hits off each of them with ease. Meanwhile, as he gives his sermon at church, James expresses regret for not properly supporting his son. After Rickey has hit on all ten of his at bats, Murff summons major leaguer Jimmy Hammer to pitch against him. Hammer then hits him in the rib on a pitch; Murff snidely tells him to take first base, but Rickey insists on staying and successfully connects on the ensuing pitch. After the game, Rickey and James reunite in the outfield, where the latter remarks he will ""have to get used"" to Rickey's newfound career.
In an epilogue, he signs with the Montreal Expos in 1975 and plays four seasons in the minor leagues before his spine gives out.[4]

201,The Equalizer 3,"At a secluded winery in Sicily, Robert McCall kills a gangster, Lorenzo Vitale, and his henchmen to obtain a key to the winery's vault and recoup money stolen in a cyber-heist. While leaving the winery, Robert is shot in the back by Vitale's adolescent grandson. Robert considers suicide due to his injury, but finds his gun out of bullets and then takes the ferry to go back to the mainland. While driving on the Amalfi Coast, Robert pulls over and slips into unconsciousness from shock, where he is found and rescued by Gio Bonucci, a local carabiniere.
Bonucci brings him to a remote coastal Italian town called Altamonte, where he is treated by small-town doctor Enzo Arisio. Robert gets acquainted with the locals and becomes fond of the town and its people. Robert makes an anonymous phone call to CIA officer Emma Collins to tip her off about the winery's role in the illegal drug trade disguised as normal business transactions in Sicily. Collins and other CIA operatives arrive at the winery and find millions in cash along with bags of fenethylline tablets hidden in a storeroom, confirming Robert's suspicions.
Meanwhile, the members of the Camorra harass and kill villagers in an attempt to coerce them out of their housing and take over Altamonte for commercialization purposes. Robert overhears Marco Quaranta, a high-ranking Camorra member, pressuring local store owner Angelo for payments. To make an example, the Camorra firebombs Angelo's fish store as the entire town watches. Bonucci reviews video of the firebombing and calls the Italian central police for an inquiry. Along with his wife and daughter, Bonucci is attacked by the Camorra and beaten for interfering in their operations.
Sometime after, Marco demands that Bonucci set up a boat for them; overhearing them, Robert asks them to move their operations to a different location. When Marco refuses, Robert kills him and his henchmen. The Naples head of police is threatened and tortured by Vincent, Marco's brother and head of the Camorra, to find the person behind Marco's death. Vincent has Collins's car rigged with a bomb, but she survives after Robert warns her. Vincent threatens to shoot Bonucci in front of the entire town, only for Robert to reveal himself, but the citizens begin to record the ordeal on their camera phones, causing Vincent and his gang to retreat and return to his home where they make preparations to retaliate the following day.
However, in order to kill Vincent later that night, Robert arrives at his home, infiltrates it and kills his bodyguards, and then forces Vincent to take a lethal dose of his own drugs. Through Collins, Robert returns the money he had taken from the winery to an elderly couple's pension fund. Back in Langley, Virginia, Collins receives a promotion for her role in ending the Altamonte drug trade. She receives a package containing a book of contacts and note from Robert congratulating her, and declaring her mother would be proud of her – revealing Collins to be the daughter of Robert's longtime friend and colleague Susan Plummer. With the Quaranta brothers dead, Robert celebrates with the locals after their football team's victory.

205,The Nun II,"In 1956, Father Noiret and young Jacques perform their daily chores in their church in Tarascon, France. While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death before a terrified Jacques who then flees.
Four years following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has befriended a young Irish student named Sophie and her teacher and mother, Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him. She is dispatched by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe, attributed to the demon Valak, due to her previous experience with the demon. She travels to Tarascon with Sister Debra, a young novice who expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles, such as the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.
In Tarascon, Irene is haunted by Valak and has a strange vision. Sister Debra tells Irene that she received Noiret's rosary from Jacques. At school, Sophie is bullied by classmates and locked in the deconsecrated sealed-off chapel. The bully points out the goat on the stained-glass window, claiming the devil appears when the sun shines through and turns the goat's eyes red. One night, the headmistress encounters a sleepwalking Maurice and is killed by Valak in the guise of her deceased son.
Irene and Debra travel to the Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian. He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God and the emblem on Noiret's rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire, she miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing St. Lucy's descendants because it wants this powerful relic, last known to be stored in a former monastery-turned-winery. The winery then became the present-day boarding school.
At the school, Irene and Debra face off against a fully possessed Maurice. Sophie shows the women the stained-glass goat in the chapel and they use a flashlight to make its eyes glow red. The red light acts as a laser-like pointer, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic and the stained-glass goat vanishes, reappearing in real life as a demonic creature.
As the goat attacks the students, Maurice attacks Irene, chases Sophie, and causes the bell tower to collapse. Debra admits to Irene that she now has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice, but he grabs it, causing Valak to appear. Similar to Father Noiret, Valak lifts Irene in the air and sets her ablaze. Irene does not burn as Valak realizes she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the same power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra pray the Words of Institution as the old barrels of wine in the room become the blood of Christ, banishing the demon.

206,My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3,"Roughly a year after My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, the family is still mourning both Gus Portokalos and Ian's father Rodney. Meanwhile, Athena and her husband Yianni are caring for Maria due to dementia. A separated Nick has returned to the family home and is again behaving immaturely. Toula Portokalos-Miller and Ian are still very happily married, with Ian having recently retired from his job as a teacher. Their daughter Paris is struggling in college, unbeknownst to her parents.
The mayor of Vrisi (Gus' former village) has invited Toula, Ian, Paris, Nick, Aunt Voula, and Aunt Freida there for a supposed reunion. Aunt Voula surprisingly secretly hires Aristotle, a Greek-American that Paris knew in college, as her assistant. Toula takes Gus's journal containing his life story to give to his three childhood friends in Greece as promised.
Distant relative Victory, the non-binary mayor who had invited them, greets the family upon arrival. They drive by Athens' beautiful sights, then have a ceremonial swim to celebrate their arrival to the homeland.
They eventually find Gus' childhood home in the nearly abandoned Vrisi. Although unsure, they decide to make the best of the situation by living as Gus did. The next day, they meet Alexandra, Gus' old flame. Victory admits there is no reunion, and hopes they will rejuvenate the village, but the Portokaloses are the first. Victory is only the mayor because the other five people left in Vrisi didn't want the job.
The next day, in a nearby town, Toula looks for Gus' friends, but no one knows them. Given several shots of ouzo, she gets very drunk, though she remembers a man watching her. Paris brushes off Aristotle and is hiding a secret. Nick, after pranking Ian with a cold shower, searches for the village's oldest tree. Meanwhile, Ian befriends a monk who has info on everyone's comings and goings from the village.
At dinner that night they meet Peter, the man Toula saw watching her. He is Alexandra and Gus's illegitimate son, who he never knew about, Toula and Nick's half-brother. They also meet Christos, Peter's son, and Alexandra's Syrian assistant Qamar. Afterwards, Christos and Qamar take Aristotle and Paris to a club, where they reveal they are secretly betrothed.
The next day, Toula tells Maria, Athena and Yianni about Peter, but has no luck finding Gus' friends. However, the monk gave Ian a list of the people who left the village, revealing one that moved to Syros. As Cousin Nikki vacationed there, Toula tells her. Nikki and her brother Angelo travel to Syros, and track him down. He leads them to the others, and they travel to Vrisi.
Meanwhile, Toula discovers Nick brought Gus's ashes to Greece, as he'd wanted them to be spread around the oldest tree in Vrisi. That night, the family discovers Christos and Qamar's engagement and that Paris is on academic probation. Peter and Alexandra disapprove, while Ian offers to intercede for Paris, but the younger generation refuse, wanting to handle their own problems.
The next day, Peter accepts Christos and Qamar's relationship, while Alexandra eventually does too. Victory, realizing a wedding is a great way to bring people to the village, plans theirs. Toula and Ian are encouraged to relax, so they enjoy their vacation while the others set up the wedding, although they do help at the end.
Qamar's family arrive for her and Christos' wedding in a great celebration. Paris admits she broke up with Aristotle due to her struggles to be independent, and they agree to start again slowly, to Aunt Voula's pleasure. Nikki and Angelo arrive with Gus' friends, and Toula gives them his journal. Later, Toula, Nick and Peter privately spread Gus' ashes around the tree, as Alexandra helped them find it.
Alexandra finally commends Victory's work as mayor. Meanwhile, Toula and Nick argue about who will now become head of the family, each saying it should be the other due to their actions on the trip.
On the way to the airport, Toula believes Gus knew they needed to return to the homeland. They bring Peter to welcome him into the family. At the airport, Ian gets Nick to act crazy in public. When the rest of the family arrives to pick them up, Nick offers Toula to host the next family dinner, and she responds with ""wear your eating pants"", an Alexandra expression.

207,Sitting in Bars with Cake,"In Los Angeles, best friends since they were seven, Jane and Corinne live together. Corinne is the ultimate extrovert, while Jane is extremely shy.
Corinne works with powerhouse talent agent Benita initially as her assistant, where Jane works in the mailroom. Jane has a crush on lawyer Owen who is interning in the company, but initially hides from him because of her timidity.
On March 7th, Corinne's birthday, Jane brings her homemade birthday cake out with them. Corinne insists they share it around the bar. This inspires Corinne's idea to get Jane, to commit to a year of baking cakes and bringing them to bars with the goal of meeting people.
Corinne and Jane map out a plan to hit one bar a week for a year. They try to hit all sorts of different demographics, and she tailor-makes each to reflect their clientele. Corinne also chooses Jane's outfits to improve her chances.
Jane's parents Tasha and Isaac take her and Corinne out for Chinese, as they are in LA for a lawyers conference. Well-respected human rights lawyers, they expect her to follow in their footsteps, although she actually wants to become a professional baker.
During their cake experiment, they tally Jane's success in interacting with men. The first sends her a dick pic, she line dances with another, gets numbers and kisses.
Meanwhile, Benita promotes Corinne to junior agent. Jane and friends celebrate that night for drinks, but later on Corinne has a seisure following an extreme headache. An MRI and biopsy confirm a brain tumor, a life-altering diagnosis.
Corinne's parents Ruth and Fred Thompson try to take her back to Phoenix, Arizona for treatment, but she chooses to stay in Los Angeles. Jane insists she can handle it, but they stay until they are sure. In the meantime her dad constantly finds handyman projects around to do.
During her treatment, Corinne still goes with Jane and cakes to bars, calling it cakebarring. Their boss  organises a 5K run fundraising event for Corinne and also acupucture and an emotional support dog.
Meanwhile Jane is finally brave enough to meet with Owen, under the guise of learning more about international property law. Corinne is thrilled, especially as it's a way to distract away from her cancer.
In November Corinne breaks up with Dave, she tells Jane's parents about her disinterest in law and the cancer fundraiser takes place. She also unfortunately receives bad news from her doctor that her cancer now is more aggressive than originally believed and essentially terminal, especially as attempts to join a clinical trial are unsuccessful.
By Thanksgiving Corinne has had to return to the hospital for a time. With 17 cakes left to deliver via cakebarring, Jane gets a second wind. Christmas rolls around and she finally starts to have a clearer idea of what she wants. Jane realises that Owen may not be 'the one', and she finally tells her parents that the idea of law school doesn't inspire her.
They go to a bar with everyone to do karaoke, a favorite activity of Corinne's. When she's too weak to finish a song, mega-timid Jane pushes aside her stage fright to support her.
Quitting her mailroom job to become Corinne's fulltime caregiver for her remaining months, Jane both says goodbye to her job and Owen, who she's decided to stop dating. The girls are together right up to the end.
They have her celebration of life in Arizona.
Although heartbroken, Jane delivers the 50th cake, Corinne's birthday cake. Then as promised, she opens her specialty cake shop Silverlake Cake Bar in LA.

Forcing him to go clubbing with her and her friend, Hardin cannot enjoy himself as he has continual flashbacks of Tessa. Katherine and her friend get Hardin to take them to his place but he's not enjoying himself, drinking until he passes out.
Over a lunch with his mother and birth father the next day, Hardin is reprimanded for drinking again, wallowing and not trying to move on. Explaining that Tessa was his whole reason for being and his muse, he has writer's block. Hardin's mum suggests he makes peace with the past, then mentions Natalie, from his youth is now living in Lisbon.
Hardin flies down to make amends with Natalie, going to the bridal shop where she works. She ushers him out, but meets with him later. Hardin has a flashback to when they'd met. To recover an expensive watch in a poker game, he accepted a bet to seduce her and record it.
Natalie moved to Lisbon to escape the backlash from Hardin's friend making the video go viral. She's also lost her means to go to college, so decided to make a fresh start. After they've caught up, Natalie invites Hardin to meet her and her friends on the beach. There Sebastian, a guy wary of him, talks him into cliff diving.
Sailing the next day with Natalie, telling her about when Tessa broke up with him, Hardin is made to realise both situations were similar. Both had their private lives made public with no warning. Back on the beach, Sebastian and his friends beat Hardin up for making advances toward another one of his friends, who gets locked up in jail.

210,A Haunting in Venice,"In 1947, Hercule Poirot has retired to Venice, having lost his faith in God and humanity, with ex-police officer Vitale Portfoglio as his bodyguard. Mystery writer Ariadne Oliver persuades Poirot to attend a Halloween party and séance at the palazzo of famed opera singer Rowena Drake, wishing to expose Joyce Reynolds—a World War I army nurse turned medium—as a fraud. The palazzo, a former orphanage, is believed to be haunted by the spirits of orphaned children who were locked up and abandoned to die there during a city-wide plague; rumors claim that the spirits torment any nurses and doctors who dare enter.
Rowena has hired Joyce to commune with her daughter Alicia, who committed suicide after Alicia's fiancé, chef Maxime Gerard, ended their engagement. Among the guests are Rowena's housekeeper Olga Seminoff, Drake family doctor Leslie Ferrier and his son Leopold, and Joyce's Romani assistant Desdemona Holland; they are joined by Maxime right before the séance, and during it Poirot reveals Desdemona's half-brother Nicholas—and Joyce's second assistant—hiding in the chimney. Joyce suddenly speaks in Alicia's voice, saying that one of the guests murdered her. Poirot confronts Joyce, who insists he lighten up, gives him her mask and robe, and cryptically says they will not meet again. Seconds later, an unknown assailant nearly drowns Poirot when he is apple bobbing, while Joyce falls from an upper story and is impaled on a courtyard statue.
With a storm cutting off the palazzo, Poirot interviews the guests, during which he witnesses manifestations of Alicia's ghost and hears a young girl humming a tune. The investigation yields perplexing results:
When the guests discover an underground chamber containing children's skeletal remains and bees, Leslie suffers a panic attack and nearly kills Maxime. He is locked inside the music room to recover, Rowena giving Poirot the only key. After examining Maxime's invitation, Poirot deduces Ariadne sent it and is conspiring with Vitale: Vitale, who investigated Alicia's death and resigned from the police as a result of the case, gave Joyce private details, while Ariadne had hoped to use Poirot's inability to explain the supernatural as a plot for her next book. Leslie is then found dead with a knife in his back.
Gathering the remaining guests, Poirot reveals Rowena caused the deaths of Alicia, Joyce, and Leslie, hoping to pass them off as part of the children's curse. Obsessed with keeping Alicia for herself, Rowena poisoned her with small doses of the honey of Rhododendron ponticum, weakening and then caring for a hallucinating Alicia (the same honey seemingly caused Poirot's visions) to isolate her from Maxime when they planned to reconcile; the night of Alicia's suicide, Olga unknowingly gave Alicia tea containing a fatal dose and Rowena, fearful of exposure, staged everything. When blackmail threats arrived, Rowena suspected either Joyce or Leslie. She attempted to drown Poirot, realized that she had mistaken him for Joyce, and then pushed Joyce to her death. Later, over the palazzo's internal phone line, she forced Leslie to stab himself by threatening to kill Leopold. When Poirot confronts Rowena on the roof, Alicia's ghost seems to appear to them both, pulling Rowena down off the building and into the canal where she drowns.
As dawn breaks, Poirot parts ways with Ariadne and chooses not to report Vitale's fraud. Later, Poirot privately confronts young Leopold, the true blackmailer who needed to support himself and his father: Leopold had identified the poisoning signs that his physician father missed and realized Rowena's first starring role was in an opera whose lead character is the ""king of poisons"". Poirot suggests Leopold and Olga clear their consciences by financially helping the Hollands begin anew in St. Louis. His faith mostly restored, Poirot returns home to accept new cases.

211,Dumb Money,"Keith Gill is a lower middle class man working as a financial analyst in Brockton, Massachusetts. During his spare time, he regularly frequents the stock market subreddit r/WallStreetBets, posting his opinions on it via YouTube live streams under the name Roaring Kitty. He struggles to provide for his family, and his YouTube work is constantly mocked by his brother Kevin as nerdy garbage.
In July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Keith notices that video game retailer GameStop's stock is falling and sinks his life savings into buying stock in it, regularly live streaming updates with his viewers. Despite Kevin and several peers claiming this is a waste of time, by January 2021, activity on r/WallStreetBets reveals that several hedge fund investment firms, including Melvin Capital Management and its founder Gabe Plotkin, have been short selling stock in the chain on the assumption it would close, causing a mass increase in GameStop's overall stock price when online stock buyers, including struggling nurse Jennifer, GameStop retail employee Marcos, and lesbian college couple Riri and Harmony, start aggressively buying stock, causing Plotkin and other investment CEOs to lose hundreds of millions within the same timeframe and Keith to be heralded as a financial guru.
Things take a turn when r/WallStreetBets is temporarily shut down for ""inflammatory and vulgar content"", causing a mass surge of panic selling in GameStop's stock in an attempt to beat a perceived price drop. When the commission-free stock trading website Robinhood is unable to adequately pay the money for the sales, co-chairman Vlad Tenev, at the behest of Citadel LLC owner Ken Griffin, halts all purchasing of GameStop's stock in an attempt to drive down the price. The play ultimately works, but the subsequent negative backlash results in an investigation by the United States House Committee on Financial Services, with Tenev, Griffin, Plotkin, and Keith all being subpoenaed, the former three for their roles in the fiasco and the latter on suspicion of using the situation to trick the public into making himself rich. As the investors struggle to defend their actions, Keith adamantly denies any wrongdoing, stating he was only doing what anyone with a passing awareness of investment banking would do in that situation.
In the aftermath, post text shows how several of the individuals were affected: Plotkin was forced to shut down Melvin Capital because of the net losses the incident caused; Robinhood was the target of several lawsuits following the fiasco and wound up starting in the stock market significantly lower than it was prior; Harmony was able to use the money she obtained to pay off her family's debt issues and continues her relationship with Riri; Marcos sold half of his GameStop stock and quit his position in the company; Jennifer remains in debt but has retained her shareholding; Keith retired from YouTube in late April to get out of the public eye and sold part of his stocks to get Kevin an expensive car as a way to stop his nagging about how he will not loan him his car for his food deliveries.

212,Love at First Sight (2023 film),"20 y.o. American student Hadley Sullivan, constantly late and always with minimum charge on her phone, just misses her flight to London, but is rebooked on the next.
While at the mobile phone charging station, Hadley meets British 22-year old Yale student Oliver Jones, who lends her his charger. Getting along well, they eat dinner together at the cafeteria. Hadley explains she is unenthusiastically flying to London for her dad Andrew's second wedding. However, Oliver encourages her to forgive and reconcile with him.
Oliver reveals he is studying statistical inference and conducting a not-specified research project. As he is carrying a garment bag, Hadley assumes he is also going to a wedding, which he does not contest.
Upon boarding, they part ways but, as Oliver's seat belt is broken, he is moved to the seat next to Hadley. They spend the flight falling in love.
After landing, Oliver puts his phone number into Hadley's so she can text him, but it dies and she loses the number. With no way to find him, Hadley goes to the wedding, arriving right before it's due to start. Although still struggling with her father's decision to remarry, Hadley is struck by his fiancée Charlotte's kindness and consideration.
After the ceremony, Hadley overhears family friends telling Charlotte that they’ll be leaving early to attend a memorial service. After hearing some of the details about the woman who died, particularly the part about an older son travelling from America to attend the service, Hadley realizes that Oliver has actually come to London to attend his mother’s memorial, not a wedding. Hadley spontaneously decides to go to the memorial as the wedding reception doesn't start for hours.
6
Meanwhile, Oliver's brother Luther collects him at the airport to head to the Shakespeare-themed memorial. There, he sees his still-alive mother Tess, who has decided to attend her own memorial so she could experience it herself. She had successfully treated lung cancer 14 years prior but is relapsed and is now terminal. Oliver is unhappy she won't undergo treatment but Tess points out that whatever treatment she takes, she'll still die.
Hadley successfully finds the memorial service, where she meets Luther and his parents. After overcoming her initial confusion over Tess still being alive, she eventually finds Oliver.
Oliver is happy to see Hadley, and tries to downplay how he feels about his mother's death. When she presses him to be honest, and not use statistics to rationalize the situation rather than let himself feel what's happening, Oliver lashes out. So Hadley awkwardly leaves, although he apologizes, they do not part on good terms.
Oliver delivers Tessa's eulogy. In it, he confesses that he has attempted to measure his life in numbers to help make sense of his world. However, he cannot reduce his mother’s presence and meaning to simple statistics.
Hadley, meanwhile, realises she forgot her backpack at the memorial and attempts to return to the wedding reception on foot, but gets lost. She borrows a phone and calls her dad, who comes to get her with Charlotte. Andrew commends Hadley for taking a chance and provides her with closure over her feelings about his divorce from her mother.
Andrew and Charlotte both apologize that their excitement to involve her in their plans unintentionally put pressure on Hadley. Father and daughter reconcile and they all go to the reception together.
Following the memorial, Oliver's family teases him about Hadley, but Oliver insists it's futile to pursue her as the odds of their relationship working out are low. Having found Hadley's backpack, they find Andrew's wedding invitation inside and encourage Oliver to go see her. Oliver's father Val tells him that even if he had known that Tess would eventually die of cancer, he wouldn't have done anything differently. So Oliver goes after Hadley.
Finding Hadley at the reception, Oliver admits his three greatest fears: germs, the dark, and surprises, due to his mother's cancer diagnosis. She then gives him a happy surprise by kissing him. When Hadley asks Oliver what it is he's researching, he reveals it's the statistical probability of love at first sight.
Hadley and Oliver are eventually married for 58 years and have a daughter.

213,A Million Miles Away (film),"In the late 1960s and 70s, José is a young boy whose family travels from Michoacán as migrant workers picking grapes in California, his parents hoping to buy a house back home after they’ve made enough money. While they are working in the harvest season, José attends school and works in the fields with his family after. His teacher, Ms. Young, notices his potential and visits his parents at home to express her concern over the disruption to his studies by going back and forth as migrant workers. After his father is only paid partial wages for his work, he realizes José’s teacher was right to be concerned and the family decides to stay in California full time.
Years later, José graduates from the University of the Pacific and is hired as an engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Feeling as if he needs to fit in better, he trades in his customized 1963 Chevrolet Impala for a used Mazda RX-7. While signing the paperwork, he meets Adela, whom he asks out. After an intimidating first meeting with her family, they see each other more until they marry. They have five kids and José continues to work successfully at the lab, now instructing the researchers who had previously ignored him.
One day during class, José’s boss offers him a chance to join a team going to Russia to evaluate a shipment of enriched uranium the United States is looking to purchase for NASA, noting that a trip like that would look really good on an application to the NASA space program. After several rejections, José hand delivers his 12th application in person to Frederick Sturckow who trains incoming astronauts and is a veteran of the Space Shuttle program. He makes a positive impression on Sturckow and is accepted into the program shortly thereafter.
José struggles with the training, falling further behind the rest of his class. When he learns of the death of Beto (a cousin and close friend of his), he loses focus and is exhorted by Sturckow to catch up with the rest or he may be dismissed from the program. He later has a conversation with the head trainer, Kalpana Chawla, who describes to him why going to space makes all of their hard work worthwhile, and ends by letting him know she’s been selected as the Mission Specialist for STS-107 on Space Shuttle Columbia.
As José sits with his family watching the broadcast of Columbia’s re-entry, they are shaken when news comes in that Columbia didn’t survive. Nevertheless, José continues on and begins excelling among his classmates at NASA.
In 2008, Sturckow pulls José into a conference room to meet with the selection team, who informs him that he’s been chosen to join STS-128 as their Mission Specialist. José visits Adela’s restaurant outside the NASA grounds and tells her the news, with his family later watching him at the press conference. He quotes Beto's words to him that it's fitting for a migrant farmworker to go into the unknowns of space. As he enters quarantine in preparation for the mission, Adela visits him with a surprise: his former teacher Ms. Young, who tells him she’s been waiting for this moment for over 30 years, having followed his progress and career, always believing in his enormous potential.
The launch day finally arrives, José is prepared along with the rest of the crew who board the shuttle, and launch into orbit. After main engine cutoff, José looks around at the shuttle cabin and imagines seeing the same Monarch Butterfly that landed on his dad’s arm the day their family decided to stay in California, hinting that he had achieved his destiny.
Closing titles note that Mission STS 128 remained on board the International Space Station for 13 days, and that José had tacos and listened to José Alfredo Jiménez’s “El Hijo del Pueblo” while there. José was the first migrant farmworker in space, and still picks grapes with his father today, albeit in his own vineyard: Tierra Luna Cellars in Lodi, California.

217,The Expendables 4,"The Expendables are sent to Libya to prevent mercenary Suarto Rahmat from stealing nuclear warheads for a mysterious terrorist named Ocelot. The team is led by Barney Ross and formed by members Lee Christmas, Toll Road, and Gunner Jensen, with new members Easy Day and Galan. However, they are incapacitated when all of their vehicles are destroyed in the ensuing fight. When Rahmat shoots their plane down, the team finds what appears to be Barney's burned corpse in the wreckage, identified solely by his ring.
At Barney's memorial service, CIA operative Marsh reveals that the team will pursue Ocelot and Rahmat, but without Christmas, who jeopardized the mission trying to save Barney. He is replaced by Gina, his former lover, who also brings an operative named Lash into the team. The team travels to Asia, but is secretly tracked by Christmas, who had slipped Gina a tracking device earlier. Barney's apparent death opened a sealed file which states that there is an eyewitness that could identify Ocelot.
Ocelot plans to provoke World War III by letting the nuclear warheads explode in the Russian Far East, transporting them on a ship disguised as an American aircraft carrier. As the Expendables and Marsh board the ship, they are ambushed and taken hostage. Marsh is taken away to negotiate a prisoner-exchange for the eyewitness.
Meanwhile, Christmas travels to Thailand to recruit former Expendable Decha, who has turned towards pacifism but agrees to bring him to the ship to avenge Barney. As Christmas fights his way through the ship, Decha has a change of heart and helps him rescue the rest of the team. They launch an attack on Rahmat's forces, during which Christmas fights and kills him. However, Toll has been heavily wounded and needs immediate medical care.
During the prisoner exchange, Marsh is revealed to be Ocelot, hoping to financially profit from igniting World War III. While the team leaves on Decha's boat to save Toll, Christmas stays behind to turn the ship around to avoid a global conflict. He confronts Marsh, who is killed by Barney, who surprises everyone by revealing that he faked his  death, hoping to lure Ocelot out of hiding.

219,Reptile (film),"Will Grady finds his girlfriend Summer Elswick brutally murdered in a rural Maine house that they had been showing for sale as realtors. Tom Nichols and his partner Dan Cleary, police detectives assigned to the case, question Will, who reveals he wanted to marry Summer but could not as she was still married to Sam Gifford. Video evidence from nearby security footage shows a dark-colored car with a missing hubcap that Dan identifies as a 1990 Buick LeSabre; later on, Tom's wife Judy correctly identifies the vehicle as a Chrysler Imperial.
After Summer's funeral, Will tells Tom of Eli Phillips, who tried to force himself into his mother's house a few nights earlier. Will explains that, when his father ran the family's real estate company, they had forcibly bought Eli's family farm. Eli's father committed suicide, and Eli blames Will's family for it. Questioned by Tom and Dan, Eli accuses Will of murdering Summer. Eli has also been researching Tom himself, briefly discussing a corruption scandal involving Tom's former partner at a Philadelphia precinct.
DNA analysis of semen found inside Summer matches that of Sam. This goes along with a statement from a friend of Summer's that the two of them were still seeing each other to have sex. Tom returns to Sam's with a warrant. Sam grabs Dan's gun and is fatally shot by Tom while attempting to flee. A search of his house finds 13 kilograms of heroin.
The deceased Sam is declared to be Summer's murderer, but Tom is hesitant to consider the case solved. Eli shows up at his house at night and gives him a flash drive with evidence that Summer was caught up in a scheme by the Gradys to launder drug money. Properties are planted with drugs and then commandeered via civil asset forfeiture. The Gradys, operating under a shell company called White Fish, then snap up the properties at a discount. Summer was murdered to stop her from reporting the scheme to the DEA.
Evidence points to police officer Wally Finn being behind White Fish, as he also heads a private security company called Active Duty Consulting that uses the same post office box as White Fish. Will shows up at Eli's house demanding the flash drive back. Another person shows up. Tom later arrives at Eli's house and finds him missing.
Tom attends the birthday party for Captain Robert Allen, his superior officer and Judy's uncle. He attempts to inform Allen of Wally's role in Summer's murder and the money laundering scheme, but is interrupted. Later at the party, Tom discovers a Chrysler Imperial in Allen's garage with a new paint job. Allen finds Tom and tells him to let the matter go.
Fearing for his safety, Tom comes home with Judy, explains what he knows to her, and tells her they must leave that night. Allen calls and tells Tom to come over the next day, where he will explain the matter. Tom agrees. He gives the flash drive to police chief Marty Graeber, and the two go together to Allen's house. Marty excuses himself to go to the bathroom, and Allen pleads with Tom to leave to save his life, before going upstairs, where an unseen person fatally shoots him. Tom confronts Marty, who is in on the scheme, in the bathroom. Marty reaches for his gun but Tom shoots and kills him. He then shoots Wally (who was the man upstairs who killed Allen) and subdues him.
The FBI arrests Will as he is golfing.

222,No One Will Save You,"Brynn is a seamstress who lives alone in her childhood home in a forest on the outskirts of a small town. Mourning the loss of both her best friend, Maude, and her mother, Sarah, Brynn copes by constructing a model town in her living room. She leads a solitary existence and is shunned by the local townspeople. One night, she awakens to discover that a humanoid alien has broken into her home. The alien uses telekinesis to subdue her, but she accidentally kills it in self-defense with the broken fragment of a model bell tower.
Finding that her car and all of her electrical devices have been rendered useless since the alien intrusion, Brynn cycles into town, where she uncovers evidence of alien attacks on her neighbors. The town appears unaffected as she makes her way to the local police station, where she unexpectedly encounters Maude's parents, who happen to be the chief of police and his wife. Maude's embittered mother spits in Brynn's face. Brynn flees the town on a bus, but several passengers attempt to restrain her and are revealed to be controlled by alien parasites placed in their throats. She escapes and discovers that many of the townspeople now appear to be under the parasites' control.
Brynn returns home and fortifies her house. That evening, a tractor beam from a flying saucer carries the alien's corpse out of her house, and she is forced to fend off two more alien intruders; she impales the smaller one with a broken mop handle and immolates the bigger one when its legs become entangled in her car and she ignites the gas tank. After she runs back into her house, another alien restrains her and places a parasite in her mouth, seemingly being forced to do so against its will. Brynn experiences an intense hallucination in which her life is back to normal and Maude is still alive. She apologizes to Maude before breaking free of the hallucination and pulling the parasite from her mouth, finding herself lying in a field. A flying saucer arrives and transforms the parasite into a doppelgänger of Brynn, which pursues the real Brynn into the woods.
The doppelgänger catches Brynn and stabs her, but Brynn kills it with a box cutter and escapes to a deserted road. She encounters a gigantic alien before being sucked into a flying saucer, where she is psychically probed by a group of aliens, revealing the event that turned the town against her: during an argument she had with Maude when both were children, Maude knocked Brynn to the ground and Brynn struck Maude with a rock, killing her. The aliens converse with one another and appear to agree on a course of action. They return Brynn to the deserted road, unharmed and free of their influence.
Brynn rebuilds her home and discovers that the other residents remain under the control of the parasites. They now treat her kindly and since she has finally overcome her trauma, she can live a normal life. In the sky, numerous flying saucers are seen stretching off into the horizon.

223,It Lives Inside,"Samidha, or ""Sam"", is an Indian-American high school student who has been assimilating into western society. While her mother, Poorna, is insistent that Sam continue to follow traditions and pay respect to her heritage, her father, Inesh, is less strict towards her. At school, Sam tries to reject her culture to fit in with her white friends and has a budding romance with her classmate, Russ. As a result, she has grown apart from her former best friend and fellow Indian student, Tamira, who is now a social outcast for acting withdrawn and carrying a strange glass jar. This concerns their teacher, Joyce, but Sam believes Tamira is fine.
At night, Tamira feeds the jar raw meat but something inside the jar starts damaging it. The next day at school, Tamira privately approaches Sam for help, claiming that a supernatural entity from a story they were told as children actually lives in the jar and has been terrorizing her. Sam, embarrassed and frustrated by Tamira, smashes the jar open, causing Tamira to have a panic attack. When Sam leaves to get help, Tamira is attacked by an invisible entity and goes missing. Sam feels guilty and begins to fear there is something sinister going on. She recovers a notebook Tamira had in her possession containing strange Sanskrit writings.
Tamira is revealed to have been abducted and held captive by the entity, which attacks and mutilates her. Sam begins to notice a strange presence around her and takes a second look at Tamira's claims. Meanwhile, Poorna grows more frustrated by Sam's disregard for Indian traditions, especially when she skips a special prayer for Tamira to hang out with Russ. Sam and Russ go to an abandoned house that belonged to another Indian student, Karan, who died alongside his family in a supposed murder-suicide. The pair discover drawings depicting a creature on the walls. The strange phenomena escalates, unnerving Sam, while Tamira suffers from daily attacks and fails an escape attempt.
Sam and Russ visit Karan's house again where they kiss. Outside, he is attacked and killed by the entity in front of Sam. A traumatized Sam starts to lose her grip on reality and suffers from frightening nightmares. Desperate for help, she convinces Joyce to help her decipher some of the notebook's texts. Joyce identifies the texts as being about a demonic spirit known as a Pishach, which feeds off negative energy before consuming the souls of its prey. The only way to stop the Pishach is to seal it inside something like a jar. Sam asks Poorna for help, who plans to lure out the Pishach. As the pair prepare food and don traditional Indian attire, Joyce is attacked at the school and badly wounded by the entity.
Inesh arrives home, only to be attacked and injured by the Pishach. It also attacks Poorna before being warded off. Sam realizes that Tamira is being held at Karan's house and races to the property to save her. Inside, she is attacked and stalked by the entity, which reveals its true form to Sam. Sam finds Tamira and confronts the entity. Realizing she can be the vessel to hold the Pishach, Sam allows it to enter and inhabit her body.
One year later, Sam has dinner with Tamira, Joyce, Poorna and Inesh, who have all recovered. The group have managed to contain the entity by feeding Sam raw meat, much like Tamira did to the jar. Later, Sam and Tamira reconcile. As Sam assures Tamira that the Pishach will never get out, she gradually begins to look more and more worried until she starts to cry.

226,The Creator (2023 film),"In 2065, an artificial intelligence (AI) detonates a nuclear warhead over Los Angeles, California. In response, most of the Western nations wage war against AI to prevent humanity's extinction; they are being resisted by people of the so-called New Asia (consisting of Southeast Asia, Japan, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and parts of India) who continue to embrace AI. The military seeks to assassinate ""Nirmata"",[a] the mysterious chief architect behind the AI advancements. The USS NOMAD (North American Orbital Mobile Aerospace Defense) is developed as an advanced space station capable of launching destructive attacks from orbit.
U.S. Army sergeant Joshua Taylor is an undercover operative with his pregnant wife Maya Fey, whom the military believes to be the daughter of Nirmata. When military forces attack their home, exposing Taylor as a covert agent seeking to use Maya to find Nirmata, Maya runs away but is hit by a subsequent NOMAD strike.
Five years later, Taylor works as part of the ground zero cleanup crew in Los Angeles. He is approached by General Andrews and Colonel Howell to join a mission to destroy a new weapon engineered by Nirmata, ""Alpha O"", believed to be capable of destroying NOMAD and thus shifting the balance of the war in favor of AI. To recruit him, they play a video showing Maya alive, and suggest he might find and reunite with her if he joins the team. In New Asia, separated from the rest of the strike team, Taylor manages to enter the compound believed to hold the weapon but discovers only a robotic ""simulant"" in the form of a young girl. It is revealed that the girl has the ability to remotely control technology. Dubbing her ""Alphie"", Taylor disobeys Howell's orders to kill Alphie and the two travel to find Drew, Taylor's former commanding officer.
Examining Alphie, Drew tells Taylor she is capable of becoming the most powerful weapon on the planet as her abilities to control technology will grow exponentially. New Asian police attack Drew's apartment, killing his simulant girlfriend Kami, as Howell and squad member McBride close in. With Drew's help, Taylor locates Maya's beacon but does not find her before being attacked, and Drew is fatally wounded protecting him. Before Drew dies, he tells Taylor that the raid five years earlier had happened because of intelligence gathered that Maya was Nirmata. Taylor and Alphie are captured by New Asian forces led by Harun, a simulant soldier and former ally of Taylor's.
Harun states that the detonation in Los Angeles was caused by a human coding error, and that the U.S. government unfairly cast the blame on AI, who only wish to peacefully co-exist with humanity. After escaping his captors, Taylor rescues Alphie and prepares to flee as Howell leads an attack on the village. Alphie intervenes with her abilities but is gravely wounded by McBride. She is rushed to Maya, who Taylor learns has been in a coma since the strike on her home, tended to by simulant monks. Because simulants cannot harm Nirmata, she is ""stranded"" and unable to die. It is also revealed that Alphie was based on Taylor and Maya's unborn daughter, who had been scanned in utero. Distressed, Taylor takes Maya off life support as Howell and her forces arrive. They are killed by Harun, who tells Taylor NOMAD must be destroyed in order for the war to end.
Taylor and Alphie are captured by U.S. forces and taken to Los Angeles, where Taylor is forced to kill Alphie with an electro magnetic pulse weapon. However, Andrews later discovers this to be a ruse, and the pair escape before Alphie can be incinerated. Boarding a lunar shuttle at the Los Angeles Interplanetary Air and Space Port, Alphie forces the spacecraft to land aboard NOMAD just as Andrews orders a large-scale assault on remaining AI bases across the globe. Taylor plants a timed explosive while Alphie disables the ship's power. Before Taylor can arrive at the escape pod, Andrews activates a tentacled robot that prevents him from entering, and Taylor is forced to eject the vehicle with Alphie in it. As NOMAD explodes, halting the strike, Taylor embraces a simulant bearing Maya's likeness, whom Alphie had activated using a memory chip containing information Howell had downloaded from Maya’s brain just after she died. Taylor spends his last few moments with Maya as NOMAD explodes, killing them both, while Alphie returns to Earth and witnesses the people celebrating NOMAD's destruction while cheering her as Nirmata.

227,Saw X,"John Kramer is told he has only months to live due to advanced brain cancer.  He attends a cancer support group meeting and befriends Henry Kessler, who later claims he has been cured by an experimental Norwegian cancer treatment conducted by a group led by Dr. Finn Pederson. A desperate John contacts the doctor's daughter Cecilia, who refers him to her clinic outside Mexico City.
On arrival in Mexico, John is driven to the clinic and introduced to Cecilia and her team—Mateo, Valentina, and Dr. Cortez—as well as patients Gabriela and Parker and the caretaker's young son Carlos, with whom he bonds. John goes under for surgery and awakens to Cecilia telling him that he is now cancer-free. Finding a new lease on life, he purchases a gift for Gabriela. However, upon returning to the clinic, he finds it abandoned. He uncovers a video simulating his supposed brain surgery and removes his bandages to find no scar on his head, revealing the entire operation to be a scam.
Deducing that ""Dr. Cortez"" was his taxi driver Diego in disguise, John kidnaps and interrogates him, then forces him to play a ""game"" where he must remove pipe bombs wired into his arms by cutting through his flesh, which he completes successfully. Meanwhile, Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda Young kidnaps Cecilia, Mateo, Valentina, and Gabriela. They wake up in the clinic, now subjects of John's Jigsaw games.
Valentina is tasked with severing her leg with a Gigli saw and extracting enough bone marrow that will connect to a gauge and deactivate the trap. She manages to amputate her leg but is unable to collect enough marrow, and a second Gigli saw decapitates her. Cecilia uses Valentina's intestines as a rope to retrieve her phone and call for help, but Amanda shocks her into submission and confiscates the phone.
Parker breaks into the clinic, demanding his money back. Amanda restrains him while Mateo is forced to drill into his own skull and remove a piece of cerebral tissue to dissolve in a test tube and obtain a key. Although he successfully performs the task, the tissue fails to dissolve in time, and a heated mask closes over his face, killing him. Next, Gabriela is suspended from shackles and subjected to ionizing radiation, tasked with freeing herself by using a sledgehammer to break her shackled limbs. She succeeds, but before Amanda can take her to a hospital, Parker forces them at gunpoint to release Cecilia.
Cecilia kills Gabriela by breaking her neck and reveals she called Parker, who is part of the scam, to rescue her. She forces John to chain himself into the trap meant for her. When she hears Carlos outside, she takes the child and chains him opposite John. The trap begins waterboarding them with blood. Parker and Cecilia leave to retrieve their bag of stolen cash from John's control room but activate a tripwire, sealing them both in the room and freeing John and Carlos. John reveals Diego outed all of the scammers—including Parker and Henry—and that he tricked Cecilia into luring Parker to the facility. A deadly chemical gas begins filling the room; the only respite is a ventilation hole large enough for one person's head, forcing Cecilia and Parker to fight each other. Cecilia kills Parker but can only watch as John, Amanda, and Carlos exit the facility, leaving her trapped.
Sometime later, Henry awakens in a dilapidated bathroom[a] with a new trap strapped to his stomach, overseen by John and Mark Hoffman.

228,Fair Play (2023 film),"Emily Meyers and Luke Edmunds, analysts at the cutthroat Manhattan hedge fund One Crest Capital, are in a secret passionate relationship unbeknownst to their coworkers. Luke proposes to Emily while at his brother's wedding, and she happily accepts. The next day, one of the company's portfolio managers is fired. Emily tells Luke she overheard her colleagues mentioning Luke being considered as a replacement and they celebrate that night. However, at a late-night meeting with Campbell, the firm's CEO, Emily learns she will be receiving the promotion. Emily reluctantly breaks the news to Luke, but he expresses his support.
As Emily settles into her new job, Luke's resentment over not being promoted becomes increasingly apparent, leading to tensions in his relationship with Emily. Luke becomes consumed with the work of a self-help guru coaching people on how to assert themselves in the workplace. When Emily questions his choice to spend $3,000 on the course, Luke suggests she could benefit from becoming more assertive, to which she becomes defensive. Luke rebuffs Emily's attempts to initiate sex and goes to bed.
While out for drinks with Campbell and Paul, a senior executive at the fund, Emily learns Campbell is seeking to get rid of Luke, considering him ineffectual. Emily attempts to advocate more for Luke in the workplace, but it backfires when Luke makes a poor trading call that loses the company $25 million, leading to Campbell insulting her. Luke attempts to rectify himself by feeding Emily insider information confirming the alleged collapse of a company whose stock the fund can short. Concerned about the trade being illegal, Emily recommends Campbell to short another company, which proves successful. When the short sale is closed, Emily receives a $575,000 commission check. Emily considers celebrating her success with Luke, who is in her office after hours to discuss strategies for future trades but opts to go to a strip club with her male co-workers. She comes home intoxicated while Luke, after seeing the check, has no interest in having sex with her.
When another portfolio manager is fired the next day, Luke wants Emily to recommend him for the role, but she hints Campbell is not interested in promoting him. Luke goes to Campbell's office and makes an elaborate speech pledging his loyalty to him, only to learn Campbell has already hired a new portfolio manager. That night, Emily learns her mother had planned a surprise engagement party for them that Friday. A drunken Luke accuses Emily of stealing his job, but Emily reveals Campbell wanted to fire him, leading Luke to storm out.
The next day, while Emily, Campbell, and Paul pitch to overseas investors, Luke barges into the conference room intoxicated and causes a scene, berating Campbell for denying him a promotion and revealing his relationship with Emily, which has violated company policy since her promotion. An infuriated Emily is unable to reach Luke over the phone, only to find him at the engagement party. The two argue in front of their families, and Emily smashes a bottle on Luke's head when he suggests she had traded sexual favors for the promotion. Emily retreats to a bathroom where Luke finds her and the two argue before having sex. During sex, Luke forces Emily forward twice, causing her face to slam against the bathroom counter. Emily tells Luke to stop, but he does not. The next morning, to protect her job, Emily tells Campbell she was being stalked by Luke and they were never in a relationship.
Emily returns home to find Luke there, having packed up his belongings and planning to move in with his brother. Infuriated by his nonchalant attitude and demanding an apology for raping her, Emily threatens Luke with a knife. She attacks Luke with the knife until he apologizes and breaks down crying. Luke begs for her forgiveness and Emily orders him to leave before dropping the knife and smiling.

232,Oracle (2023 film),"Shay, a young black woman, awakes from a troubling nightmare about a door with a red glass handle. She is a college student majoring in African-American History with emphasis on the Civil War. Money is running low with Shay and her roommate, Jasmine, but Shay gets a job offer from a woman named Kate. Kate grew up in an old plantation home nearby and has returned with her three children in tow to care for her dying mother. On her way to check out the house, Shay makes a friendly connection with her ride share driver. Wary of the job, he gives her his card in case she needs his services again. At the house, Kate is constantly apologetic for its history but often seems falsely naive about it. She introduces Shay to the children - Andrew, Chase, and Blair - and shows her a photograph of her deceased relative who fought in the Civil War and his wife. Shay leaves with no intentions of taking the job. She begins to investigate the house’s history, but can’t find anything.
Shay receives a phone call in the middle of the night from Kate. She says her mother is not expected to make it through the night, and she needs to go to the hospital. Kate’s husband is not able to make it in time, and she has no one else to call, so she asks Shay to come stay the night. Shay says no, but Kate offers her $500 for the night. Jasmine warns her about the house and tells her not to investigate too heavily. She calls her rideshare driver from before, and he drops her off at the house. Shay accidentally drops her keys in his backseat.
The children are in bed when she arrives. Kate warn her that the children get up often throughout the night. Shay begins to walk around, looking through the house. She hears a noise in the bathroom and sees Blair scrubbing her hands in the sink with scalding water. Blair keeps saying she’s sorry and that the water is too hot. Shay stops her and asks her what she’s doing. She says her mother told her to scrub all the areas where Shay had touched her. Confused and somewhat alarmed, Shay sends Blair to bed.
Shay video calls Jasmine to check in. She begins to tell her about what the incident with Blair but holds back. The image pixelates, and Shay sees herself with an iron contraption around her head. She panics and wakes from what seems to be a dream.
Shay encounters Andrew in the hallway. He tells her he’s had a nightmare and shows her a drawing he’s made of a hand reaching for a red glass doorknob just like the one in her dream. She sends him to bed and continues to explore. Chase meets her in the stairwell and asks where his mother is. At that time, Kate calls Shay to check in but hangs up quickly when her mother’s doctor approaches.
Andrew wakes again and says he’s hungry. As Shay is making him something to eat, she finds the red doorknob in a drawer. She tells him they’ve had the same dream, and the electricity goes out. Ghosts of slaves are running around the outside of the house, shouting, and Andrew senses the presence of the wife from the old photographs. Ghosts begin to torment them.
Blair wakes again, and Shay attempts to tuck her in. She asks about Shay’s mother who has passed away and wants to know if she misses her. Shay tells her she does. Blair says that she misses her best friend. She says her mother wouldn’t let her come over anymore. When Shay asks why, Blair touches Shay’s arm, pointing at her skin. Blair ask Shay if she can be her new best friend, Shay says she will. Blair begins to sing “Shortnin’ Bread,” and Shay tells her they shouldn’t sing it because of the history of the song, but Blair doesn’t understand. Rather than having to explain it to her, Shay tells her she will just clap along while Blair sings. They hear a noise on the staircase, and Blair tells her that “she is awake.“ Blair takes Shay into the closet for them to hide. She says that if she catches them, she will kill Blair.  Shay thinks she’s overreacting and quietly emerges from the closet only to be grabbed by her hair and dragged downstairs by an invisible force.
She hits a wall and stands to collect herself as she calls 911. The reception is poor, and they can’t hear her. Shay goes back upstairs to check on the kids. The boys are hiding from Shay because Andrew thinks she’s crazy and causing problems. He won’t open the door to her. She hears a noise and what seems to be Blair whispering to her. Shay follows the whispers to the bathroom and is locked inside. The faucet turns on, and she sees a distorted image of herself in the mirror with the widow’s ghost behind her. The widow grabs her by the back of the neck and attempts to force her face into the sink. Shay fights back and smashes the mirror with a brush, causing the widow to leave.
Jasmine calls Shay to tell her she found out something about the house. There was a slave revolt, and the widow from the picture killed everyone who tried to leave. Because the reception is poor, Jasmine can’t hear Shay asking for help. Jasmine is seen headed toward the house to help her.
Chase wants to leave the closet to go find Shay, but they find they are locked inside. Shay sees the widow in the hallway and runs at her to attack her, but the ghost disappears. Shay runs downstairs and sees the door with the red glass doorknob. The door is shaking as if people are trying to escape. At this time, her rideshare driver who found her keys in the backseat has shown back up the house to return them. She tries to let him in but is distracted when she sees the widow approaching her from across the room. Shay sees a ghost outside. The rideshare driver finds a broken window and approaches Shay, but a piece of glass falls, impaling him, and he dies.
Shay finds Blair hiding under a bed and joins her. Blair tells her she must stay hidden or the woman will hear her. From beneath the bed, they see the woman come into the room. Blair gets scared and runs away, the widow chasing after her. Shay runs after them both and sees that they have gone into the room with the red doorknob. At the same time, the closet the boys were locked in is opened.
Jasmine arrives at the house. Shay finds the boys in the hallway, but Chase locks himself into a closet and tells her to leave him alone. She takes Andrew into a room for them to hide. He tells her that the same thing happens every night, and Shay realizes they are in a loop. However, the ghost has been angrier since she arrived.
Jasmine finds an open door and sneaks into the house. She finds Shay and Andrew. The ghost of the widow appears before Jasmine, and Shay tries to scare her away with a weapon she’s found. The ghost disappears and Jasmine is accidentally stabbed by Shay. Andrew has gone into the room with the red doorknob. Shay attempts to leave with Jasmine who is severely wounded, but the house won’t let her, and the two are separated. Chase only sees that she has stabbed her friend, and he is frightened. He also runs into the room with the red doorknob.
Shay approaches the door and opens it. She turns on a light. She sees the two boys inside and has visions of slaves chained up inside. Shay asks where Blair is, but Chase warns her to stay back. Kate calls, and Shay tries to explain things to her. Kate is concerned. Shay keeps telling her that her daughter is missing. Kate reveals that she doesn’t have a daughter, and Shay sees Blair in the corner of the room with a bloody wound on her back. Blair warns Shay that the slaves and her mother will come for her. Shay learns that Blair is the widow’s daughter. Her best friend, Abigail, was a slave, and Blair, who is now a ghost, thinks that Shay is Abigail. Shay takes Blair‘s hand and says that they have to leave together. The widow appears, and tells Shay that she cannot have Blair. Blair was accidentally killed by her mother who was attempting to kill Abigail to stop her from leaving. The widow grabs Shay by the neck and attempts to keep her from leaving, but the ghosts of the slaves pull her back inside the house, and Shay is able to escape.

234,The Exorcist: Believer,"In Haiti, photographer Victor Fielding and his pregnant wife Sorenne, blessed by a voodoo practitioner, are on their honeymoon until a massive earthquake ensues. Sorenne is gravely injured, and paramedics tell Victor he must choose to save either his wife or child.
Thirteen years later, Victor has lost faith in God since Sorenne's death, and raises his daughter Angela by himself in Georgia. One day after school, Angela ventures into the woods with her Baptist best friend Katherine to perform a séance, attempting to contact Angela's mother. The girls go missing and a three-day manhunt ensues.
The girls are found in a barn on the third day; though traumatized, they seem relatively normal, having suffered only burns to their feet. The next day at home, Angela attacks Victor and begins convulsing, while Katherine has an outburst during a church service where the sacrament of Holy Communion is celebrated. Victor admits Angela into the hospital where their nurse neighbor Ann attends to her. Katherine's mother, Miranda, begins to theorize that the girls traveled to Hell and brought a demon back with them.
The girls' conditions worsen. Ann, convinced that Angela is possessed after the latter reveals knowledge of Ann's experience in the novitiate as a prospective nun and her secret abortion, gives Victor a memoir written by Chris MacNeil, who experienced a similar situation with her daughter Regan in 1973.[a] Chris has spent her life researching exorcisms in every culture, becoming world-renowned for her studies. Regan became distant from her mother due to the memoir's success and has not seen her since. Victor meets with Chris, who visits Angela. Visiting Katherine's home, Chris performs a deliverance ritual on Katherine, who stabs Chris in the eyes with a cross, blinding her.
Victor, Miranda, Ann, and Katherine’s father Tony reach out to the Church for an exorcism. Chris advises Victor to use methods from all different cultures, and the group seeks the help of Father Maddox, a local priest; Don Revans, Katherine's family's Baptist pastor; Stuart, a Pentecostal preacher; and Dr. Beehibe, a rootwork healer. The group plans an ecumenical exorcism, but the local Catholic diocese forbids Maddox from participating as they feel the children are suffering from a psychiatric disorder.
The girls are tied to chairs as the group proceeds with the exorcism. Ann uses a crucifix with the Saint Benedict Medal engraved on it to battle the demon. The demon reveals that Victor did not choose to keep Angela alive thirteen years ago; he chose Sorenne but she died from her injuries. As Ann reads from the biblical text of Ezekiel 16 while holy water is poured on the children, the demon begins to shriek.
The demon tells him that he needs to choose which of the girls gets to live and which one will die, and if a choice is not made, it will kill them both. While Miranda and Victor both refuse to forsake each other's child, Maddox, who has a change of heart, rejoins the group. Maddox reads from the Roman Ritual, only for the demon to snap his neck and kill him. Victor regains his faith and begins to pray the Lord's Prayer, which he learned as a child. As Victor apologizes to Angela and uses Sorenne's scarf to attempt to strengthen her against the demon, Tony yells that he chooses Katherine, and Angela flatlines.
Suddenly, Katherine wakes up in another realm and screams for her parents as the demon ""chooses"" her, revealing the one that was chosen would be the one who dies. The demon drags Katherine to Hell, while Angela starts to breathe. Police arrive as Miranda and Tony fail to resuscitate Katherine, while Victor tearfully reunites with his daughter.
In the aftermath, Angela returns to school, Miranda and Tony mourn, and Victor visits Sorenne's grave. In the hospital, Chris is reunited with Regan, who forgives her mother.

236,Totally Killer,"In the small town of Vernon, on October 27, 29, and 31, 1987, three teenage girls named Tiffany Clark, Marisa Song, and Heather Hernandez were killed by the Sweet 16 Killer, each having been stabbed 16 times on the nights of their 16th birthdays.
In the present day, teenager Jamie Hughes goes to a concert with her friend Amelia on Halloween night while her mother, Pam, stays at home. Pam used to be friends with the three victims of the Sweet 16 Killer, and while handing out candy, she is attacked by the killer, who stabs her to death. As Jamie grieves Pam's death, she helps Amelia put the finishing touches on a time machine she created for a school project and is approached by reporter Chris Dubasage, who tells her that Pam received a note from the killer that she kept secret: ""You're next, one day.""
At night, Jamie is chased by the killer and hides in the time machine, which activates and sends her back to 1987. She realizes that if she stops the Sweet 16 Killer's original spree, she can save Pam's life. Jamie, masquerading as an exchange student from Canada, discovers that Pam and her friends were despised by everyone in the town as they were bullies. Jamie manages to convince Amelia's mother, Lauren, and a teenager named Doug, her school's present-day principal, to help her. Although Jamie manages to infiltrate a party hosted by Tiffany, she is unable to stop her murder. Using the trauma to bond with Pam, she infiltrates their group and convinces them to leave for the weekend, although this backfires; they end up at the cabin where Marisa was killed in the original timeline. As Jamie works to protect Marisa, Heather is murdered instead, changing the timeline.
On Halloween night, the group reconvenes at the amusement park while Lauren works on turning a popular attraction into a makeshift time machine for Jamie to travel forward. In the present, Chris helps Amelia fix their time machine as they realize the timeline is changing. The group lures the Sweet 16 Killer into a haunted house where he attacks them, only to be impaled by Kara, the future town sheriff, with a scythe. Doug is revealed as the killer,  seeking revenge on the group for the death of his girlfriend Trish. Marisa reveals that she, Tiffany, and Heather got Trish drunk one night and let her drive home, with her dying in an accident; Pam, however, was not present. As Jamie wonders why Pam received the note, a second killer appears and slits Marisa's throat.
The second killer chases after Jamie, killing Chris' father along the way. The two face off in the new time machine as it activates and the killer is revealed to be Chris from the present. Doug was the original killer, but Chris murdered Pam and forged the note in order to generate more content for his podcast. The two fight and Jamie kicks him into the spinning machine, killing him. Upon returning to the present day, she finds that Pam is still alive. However, Jamie's intervention in the past resulted in an alternate future in which her parents got together earlier than they had originally. Consequently, she now has an older brother named Jamie and her name is now Colette.

237,V/H/S/85,"A narrator presents a documentary on a team of scientists at Stamer University studying a shapeshifting being they name ""Rory"".
Seven friends―Rob, the person recording this segment; Anna, Rob's sister; Jared, Anna's boyfriend; Drew; Robin; Kevin; and Kelly―travel in an RV to camp at a lake. Ignoring signs that warn visitors against swimming, Rob, Drew, Robin, Kevin, and Kelly enter the water on a boat while Anna and Jared stay behind. While water skiing, they are shot and killed by an unseen sniper on the shore. Moments later Rob, Drew, Robin, and Kelly regain consciousness despite their fatal injuries. Returning to shore, they find their RV has the Roman numeral for seven painted on it with blood; they also find Anna and Jared dead. The survivors conclude that the water in the lake has the ability to bring the dead back to life, and since they were the only ones in the group to go into the water, only they were resurrected. They decide to enact their revenge on their attackers as the segment ends.
The documentary reveals that ""Rory"" was found on top of a butte and brought to Stamer University to be studied by a team under the supervision of Dr. Spratling. Hoping to educate the being about human culture, Rory is contained in a small room with a TV, which broadcasts (among other things) exercise videos. Spratling is convinced that the team can communicate with Rory.
A Mexican news crew is preparing for the morning news at Ahorita TV. A massive earthquake strikes during the broadcast, which kills the entire crew except for the cameraman, Luis. He is helped out of the rubble by a rescue team. They attempt to make their way out of the building, but are blocked from exiting by the rubble. A member of the rescue team, Javier, is mortally wounded in an aftershock; he forces one of his co-workers, Karla, to expedite his death. Karla, Luis, and two other men in the group, Miguel and Eddie, make their way through a crawl space, where they enter a room with walls made of skulls and a statue of an ancient Aztec god named Mictlān. Mictlān possesses Eddie, who then kills Miguel. Mictlān materializes behind the possessed Eddie and kills him by ripping out his heart, which he then proceeds to eat. Karla succumbs to the god's influence and kills Luis, ripping out his heart as an offering. The room eventually collapses. A surviving news reporter broadcasts from outside the building, saying that ""Today, September 19th, approximately 7:20 am, will be a day to remember"".
Rory has begun to display the ability to mutate into, and vaguely resemble, a human body. The footage is interspersed with an interview of a scientist, Dr. Greyson, who had quit the team. She says that when Rory's shapeshifting abilities were discovered, Spratling should have exhibited caution.
A performance artist, Ada Lovelace opens a show for a small audience in a theater. She explains that the world has killed God and replaced him with the ""God of Technology"". She introduces a video of a demonstration of a virtual reality software device that allows its user to exist simultaneously on the physical and digital plane. Ada adorns herself with a VR headset, gloves, and a full body suit. Another video is projected that shows what Ada is seeing through her headset, depicting an electronic landscape. After Ada performs an incantation to try to awaken the ""God of Technology"", and taunts it as a ""myth"", a mysterious figure appears on the screen. Ada tries, but ultimately fails, to remove the headset. She struggles with one of her gloves before taking it off and revealing the hand underneath to be gone. The entity attacks Ada, with her injuries in the virtual world affecting her in real life. She soon succumbs to her injuries, and as the shocked crowd applauds — believing it to be part of the act — the cameraman removes the visor on the helmet, revealing that Ada's now-exposed brain and facial tissue have merged with the helmet.
Rory is shown sprouting a tentacle with spikes at the end. Later on, it's revealed that the tentacle is called the ""feeler"".
The Wrigley family are hosting a celebration in honor of their teenage daughter Ruth, who films the occasion with her cousin James. Ruth's young relative Adam shoots her with a water gun, which he reveals was given to him by ""a lady in an RV"" that is seen speeding off. That evening, the Wrigleys reveal they are celebrating an old family tradition – the murders of seven people – as a rite of passage that Ruth has completed. She produces a recording of a killing spree in which she murdered seven people at a lake (per ""No Wake""). Police sirens are heard as officers surround the family home. The family rushes to fight back, arming themselves with guns. Ruth's mother reminds her to ensure she is not taken alive, lest it bring shame on the family. As the police raid the house and shoot Ruth's family dead, Ruth kills James after he confesses he is too frightened to fight. Ruth is then gunned down by the police. As a coroner examines the bodies, Ruth revives and, in shock, shoots the coroner. Ruth shoots herself in the head but remains alive. She is arrested in great distress. The video then shows Robin, one of Ruth's victims from the lakeside massacre, filling the water gun with water from the lake.
Gary, one of the scientists, becomes disturbed when Rory takes on his appearance, as Gary is the only one in the group that has never had a face-to-face with Rory. Dr. Greyson calls for an emergency meeting. She says that Gary has never been in the chamber, then deduces that Rory can see through the one-way mirror that divides its containment and the study room. While Greyson expresses concern, Spratling sees it as a miracle, arguing Rory is breaching beyond its restraints to make contact. Greyson explains in an interview that Spratling did not deserve what happened to him, but that he brought it on himself, and that she primarily sympathizes with the people Spratling ""took with him"".
A home invasion is seen from the point of view of the killer. The woman inside can be heard on the phone with a 911 operator. The killer eventually finds her, and proceeds to tie her up with duct tape, slit her throat with an electric meat carver, and slice her eyes open with a straight razor. After the police arrive at the house, the lead detective, Wayne, comments to his partner Bobby on how the murder scene looks familiar to a videotape he received at the station a few weeks prior that showed a woman being murdered the same way. Another video from the killer's POV shows him making his way into another home and, after fighting the man inside and cutting off his fingers, the killer murders him, peeling off a piece of his leg and cutting his chest open.
Police arrive at the home and, again, Wayne explains to Bobby that he had already seen footage of this murder in a tape he received days ago. Wayne tracks the source of the tapes and captures the person responsible for sending them: Gunther, Bobby's son. When Gunther is interrogated about the tapes, he claims that he saw the murders take place in his dreams, and his dreams were being manifested into the tapes. He sent the tapes to the station as a way to warn the police. Wayne does not believe the story, but Bobby explains that their family has a psychic gift that lets them see the future. His sister committed suicide after being driven crazy from seeing them, and Gunther's cousin, Gwen, had the same psychic dreams when her brother was kidnapped.
A final tape is found, which reveals a third murder with the victim having been dismembered and decapitated. Bobby and Wayne recognize the home in the tape and go to investigate. Outside the home, Wayne confronts Bobby about having known his connections to the murders: The women murdered in the first tape and the last tape both accused Bobby of sexual assault and stalking, and the man in the second tape was an attorney representing them. Wayne also tells Bobby that he learned how Bobby had to turn in his badge after the women accused him of sexual assault and stalking. As Wayne pleads for Bobby to tell the truth, he shoots Wayne in the head, killing him instantly. Bobby then heads into the house to commit the murder from Gunther's dream. While at the police station, Gunther looks into the visor of the camera in the interrogation room and learns that it's playing back his dream.
Bobby arrives back at the station and finds Gunther, who realizes that his father is the killer. Gunther reveals that he already knows how this ends, having just seen it in a dream. As Bobby attempts to kill Gunther, police officers arrive and open fire at him. Bobby fights back and kills them, but is then killed by Gunther.
Rory is unresponsive to stimuli, which Spratling interprets as it being sick. Dr. Greyson disagrees, saying that if Rory is as intelligent as Spratling says it is, then Rory could be manipulating him. Later on that evening, Greyson abandons the study. She tries to convince others to follow her, but is unsuccessful. The documentary narrator reveals that while authorities have shared footage of what happened at Stamer University, the documentary will not show it due to the disturbing nature of the images and a concern for the well-being of the viewers. The tape cuts to a black screen revealing that the following footage is property of Stamer University, leased to the show with no intention of distribution.
After Greyson leaves the group, Spratling sends Gary into Rory's room to give him an adrenaline shot, but before he can do so, Rory exposes its ""feeler"" and wraps it around Gary's arm. While Spratling and Porter are able to get Gary out of the room, Rory sprouts another ""feeler"" that it uses to drag Gary into its room to kill him; Porter suffers the same fate. Spratling and the cameraman run to escape, but due to the blood on Spratling's hand, the door scanner cannot read his handprint. Rory's ""feeler"" extends to the hallway and kills them both. Rory then pulls the cameraman's corpse back to its room, where it has assumed an alien form and is manipulating the corpses to mimic the exercise videos shown on the TV screen.

239,Dicks: The Musical,"God narrates the tale of Craig and Trevor, two straight, womanizing, misogynistic business salesmen who are, unbeknownst to them, identical twins separated at birth by their parents. When their companies undergo a merger, they finally meet. Initially competitive with one another, they realize that they are brothers when they notice each other's matching necklace pendants and learn each other's birthdays. In each other, they finally find a kindred spirit, but dissatisfied with their experiences growing up, they hatch a plan to get their parents back together to become a ""real family"". They each disguise themselves as one another and visit their other parent: Craig visits Evelyn, their shut-in and eccentric mother whose vagina had fallen off and died, and Trevor visits Harrison, their newly out gay father, who keeps two humanoid genetic mutants called ""sewer boys"" in a cage in his home. Both parents discuss their respective issues to their sons, to the boys' horror.
Disgusted, but adamant to complete their plan, the boys trick Evelyn and Harrison into having dinner together, who both accept due to their deep loneliness. Craig and Trevor's schemes cause them to miss work, and after insulting their boss, Gloria, she fires them. At the restaurant, Evelyn and Harrison realize that their sons have met and what they are trying to do. Nevertheless, they have sex in the restaurant, to the boys' delight, but leave them crushed when they tell them they have no intention of getting married again.
The failure causes a rift between the two boys and they fall into a depression to the point that Evelyn and Harrison kidnap them both to Harrison's home to try to cheer them up. However, the sewer boys get loose and flee back to the sewers. Harrison chases after them down the sewer, and Evelyn realizes that she wants more out of life and jumps in after him, as do the boys. Searching together, they all realize that they are a true family. Seeing the sewer boys about to be exterminated by a sewage worker, Evelyn reveals that she saved her dead vagina and nursed it back to health in her hand bag, throwing it at the worker and saving the sewer boys. Harrison realizes that he must let the sewer boys go in order to spend time with his true family.
Some time later, the family all move in together into an apartment, where Craig and Trevor share a room and bed and discover their intense sexual attraction to each other. They later get married in a ceremony officiated by God, which is interrupted by protestors and religious conservatives, decrying the union of two gay identical twins. God sternly lectures the protestors for their hatefulness and declares that Craig and Trevor's union will be added into the newest edition of his best seller, The Bible. They all celebrate the union and the revelation that God is gay.

241,She Came to Me,"Operetta composer Steven Lauddem is creatively blocked and unable to finish the score for his big comeback opera. At the behest of his wife Patricia, a psychiatrist, he sets out in search of inspiration.
Taking their dog for a walk, Steven stops at a bar. There, he meets Katrina, who convinces him to go with her to see her tugboat, where she lives and works. She confesses that she's addicted to romance, and seduces Steven. Realising he may be in danger, he hurries away.
The experience inspires Steven to write the work based on what happened, but making her character a serial killer. On opening night, not only does Patricia and their son come, but so does Katrina. She approaches him, happily letting him know that she's now staying in Brooklyn, and he hurries home, terrified.
Meanwhile, Patricia's son Julian and Tereza, whose mother Magdalena turns out to be his family's new cleaner, are dating. Neither set of parents knew about the relationship, so they make formal introductions. Tereza's dad Trey does not approve of his daughter's choice of a dark-skinned boyfriend, so threatens to persecute Julian on statutory rape charges as Tereza is still underage and Julian has turned 18. As their lawyer comes for a consultation, Steven points out that Julian couldn't be prosecuted if they were married.
When Katrina approaches Steven in the street, he brushes her off, insisting she needs psychological help. She books a session with Patricia and the truth comes out. Not able to handle the news, Patricia has a psychotic break. Afterwards, Magdalena pauses her cleaning to join Julian, Steven and a nun at Patricia's bedside. Julian requests she sign in person to authorize his marriage to Tereza in Delaware, where 16 year olds can marry with a parent's signature.
Once it is decided, mother and daughter work together on how to get around Trey. In the meantime, knowing of Katrina's addiction to romance, Steven enlists her help to transport everyone to Delaware. Trey makes his wife and daughter participate in one of his Civil War reenactment battles. They feign they are collecting wood, but instead run to Steven and the tug boat.
Trey has a APB sent out for them, to no avail. As Steven, Magdalena and their kids settle in on their journey, it is suggested that Katrina become ordained online to officiate the ceremony. In the morning, Steven brings Captain Katrina her coffee in the cockpit. He apologizes for judging her previously, admiring her strength and perserverance. Katrina in turns laments her role in pushing Pat off the deep end. Declaring he finally feels he has found true love, Steven passionately kisses her.
Cutting ahead one year, we see Steven's latest opera, set in space, but obviously inspired by the Delaware wedding. The young married couple, her mom, Steven and Katrina and Pat, who's now a nun, watch the premiere. In between parts of the work, we see snippets of the wedding.

242,The Burial (film),"In 1995, financially troubled funeral home owner Jeremiah Joseph O'Keefe is forced to sell parts of his business to meet financial demands by the Mississippi State Insurance Commission. He makes a contract with Raymond Loewen of the Loewen Group, who never follows through on their oral agreement. His young lawyer Hal Dockins suggests that Loewen is intentionally trying to run O‘Keefe into bankruptcy to snatch up his entire business.
An enraged O'Keefe hires Willie E. Gary, a flashy Florida personal injury lawyer, at Dockins' suggestion, because he thinks that his white contract lawyer Mike Allred will be unable to convince the presumably black jury. Tensions between Allred and Gary rise when the latter is named lead attorney and refuses a settlement offer, instead raising it to $100 million. Upon receiving the offer, Loewen hires a black lawyer team fronted by Mame Downes for similar reasons.
In court, O'Keefe is cornered when Downes questions his character and points out his financial troubles stem from business deals with a now-convicted felon. Blaming Gary, O'Keefe replaces him with Allred as lead attorney. Dockins produces a valuable witness who insinuates that Loewen overcharges minority communities. Downes in turn questions Allred and reveals that his grandfather was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. When Gary stands up for Allred, his angered black legal team leaves him. Allred realizes he is too compromised and retracts from the case to give the team a higher chance to win.
Just when O'Keefe decides to drop the case, Dockins digs up a lead to the black National Baptist Church, revealing that the Loewen group in fact did exploit the church members to sell overpriced packages to other members of the black community. When Raymond Loewen is confronted with this in court and shows no remorse, the jury is swayed in O'Keefe's favor, awarding him $500 million in damages—$100 million in compensatory damages and $400 million in punitive damages.

248,Dark Harvest (2023 film),"In 1962, the teenage boys of a small rural town compete in the annual Halloween ""Run"": they must stop a deadly supernatural creature known as Sawtooth Jack from reaching the church before midnight. This year, Jim Shepard kills the creature and leads the boys in feasting on its candy innards, winning $25,000 and a new Chevrolet Corvette from the Harvesters Guild. As the town celebrates, Jim says goodbye to his younger brother Richie and drives away to a new life.
One year later, Officer Ricks lectures the boys about the Run; only Richie is exempt, as his family has already won. Richie flirts with Kelly, a newcomer to town, and is determined to take part in the Run, despite his parents' attempts to dissuade him. Beaten up by his bullying classmate Riley, who steals his belt, Richie is troubled by postcards and a letter from Jim. He tries to leave town in a stolen car, but is subdued by Ricks.
Meanwhile, a farmer turns an emaciated corpse into a scarecrow with a carved pumpkin for a head, sewing candy inside the body before it rises as Sawtooth Jack. As is tradition, the town's boys are locked in their rooms and starved for three days until they are let loose on Halloween, taking to the streets with masks and makeshift weapons. Richie sneaks out to join the Run with his friends Mitch, Bud, and Charlie, chasing Sawtooth Jack into a cornfield. The creature kills Charlie and Mitch, but seems to let Richie escape.
Richie finds Kelly, who has joined the hunt herself, and a traumatized Bud flees back to town. His parents refuse to let him inside, and he pleads with a group of boys hiding in a storm cellar, but Sawtooth Jack arrives and kills Bud and the others. Richie and Kelly steal a handgun from Ricks' house and his patrol car, while the increasingly feral boys begin looting and killing townspeople and each other. Accosted by Riley, Kelly knocks him unconscious and Richie reclaims his belt buckle.
Ricks uses his car's radio to lure Richie and Kelly to the center of town, where they find Sawtooth Jack. Preparing to shoot the creature, Richie recognizes its matching belt buckle and realizes this year's Sawtooth Jack is Jim. The creature escapes, and Richie and Kelly confront his mother Donna, deducing that she wrote Jim's postcards and letters. Overwhelmed with guilt, Donna stabs herself in the neck; across town, Ricks warns Richie's father Dan that the Run must be completed to prevent the town's ruination.
Richie and Kelly reach the church, where Dan reveals the town's curse: Ricks and the Harvesters Guild keep anyone from leaving, ensuring every year that Sawtooth Jack is stopped, while the new winner is transformed into the following year's creature. Richie guides Sawtooth Jack to the church to put an end to the ritual, but Ricks arrives with Riley, who shoots Sawtooth Jack. Richie holds Riley at gunpoint, but Sawtooth Jack indicates that he wants Richie to kill him, and Richie finishes his brother off with a shot to the head.
Amid the town's celebration, Richie and Kelly agree to escape together, and she slips him a gun. Presented with his winnings, Richie takes his new car to meet Kelly, but they are stopped by Ricks as Kelly hides. Taken to the scarecrow field, Richie shoots first and kills Ricks, but is ambushed by the farmer and buried alive. At Dan's urging, the devastated Kelly escapes from town in Richie's car. The following year, as Richie's body is transformed into Sawtooth Jack, Dan intervenes, killing the farmer and urging his newly risen son to take revenge on the town.

250,Dear David,"In 1996, David gets bullied over a crude drawing on instant messaging, and retaliates against them.
In 2017, two teenagers enter the late David's chat room, trolling him. After asking a third question about their future cause of death, the teenager gets killed later that night.
At BuzzFeed, Adam heeds his boss Bryce's request to create ""authentic original content"". Adam retaliates against trolls— prompting a response from David calling him ""mean"", which Adam ignores. In the next morning, Adam's rocking chair moves on its own, later seeing David on it in a hallucination, continuing with a vision of David and his past life.
Evelyn encourages Adam to get sleep— he instead researches ""Dear David"" and paranormal activity. Adam encounters David in a dream and asks who he is, with David answering he's ""just a follower"". In the next night, Adam moves to a unit upstairs in the same apartment complex, however, his hallucinations persist.
In the next day, everyone at BuzzFeed celebrate the success of the Dear David thread. Bryce tells Adam to add multimedia, and after hesitating, makes the Dear David story interactive by adding a vote on what to do if David appears again— exorcism was chosen. Trolls continue to berate Adam; he claps back. On an early morning, Adam asks what David wants with him, later waking up with nosebleed after David whacks a typewriter on his face at night. While hunting for David, he encounters Kyle, who comforts him.
Adam recounts his situation to Kyle, who resents him for his unresponsiveness, eventually leaving him in disappointment. Adam later posts that David may want him dead. After initially ignoring the unknown caller, Adam answers— the caller has his voice. At night, he gets dragged to where David is shown disturbing photos. His father scolds him for this, after which David chokes him. Linda kills David.
A representation of David is drawn the next day with half a missing head. Bryce proposes a worldwide expansion of Dear David, which Adam reluctantly agrees to. He calls Kyle to help track the owner of David's handle; he agrees despite privacy concerns.
A woman visits Adam recalling his experience with David, concluding that David may be connected to Adam. He visits Phyllis, who cites another connected case: that of ""Loopy Linda"". Adam watches her video, realizing her actions match what happened to David, who may be possessed.
Adam goes to the hospital where David was admitted, finding he is already dead. He secretly searches for David's file, discovering his body went missing. Adam goes inside Dr. Landers' home to find her, instead encountering Linda hanging by the stairs.
Adam dozes off, calling Kyle in a dream while cutting himself. Evelyn chides Adam for his responses (which he didn't send) and deserts him. Kyle tells Adam that David's handle doesn't exist, and to move on. A list sent by Norris makes Adam go livid, not realizing it said ""be yourself"" instead of ""kill yourself"". Bryce recommends a break for Adam, now seeing his reputation and credibility decline.
In a conversation with David, he accidentally asks a third question, beginning to lose control, instigating a fire; Adam sees a vision of people criticizing him.
As the complex burns, Evelyn and Kyle visit him in worry after Adam fails to answer their calls. After their reassuring remarks, Adam successfully kills David while escaping the complex with them. They apologize for dismissing Adam's claims of being haunted, and Adam, in return, promises to be more open.
Meanwhile, Chloe, one of the trolls, gets possessed and continuously smashes her head on the table.

253,Killers of the Flower Moon (film),"Osage Nation elders bury a ceremonial pipe, mourning their descendants' assimilation into White American society. Wandering through their Oklahoma reservation, during the annual ""flower moon"" phenomenon of fields of blooms,[14] several Osage find oil gushing from the ground. The tribe becomes wealthy, as it retains mineral rights and members share in oil-lease revenues, though law requires white court-appointed legal guardians to manage the money of full and half-blood members, assuming them ""incompetent"".[b]
In 1919, Ernest Burkhart returns from World War I to live with his brother Byron and uncle William King Hale on Hale's large reservation ranch. Hale, a reserve deputy sheriff and cattle rancher, poses as a friendly benefactor of the Osage, speaking their language and bestowing gifts. Ernest and Byron commit armed robbery against the Osage. Ernest meets Mollie Kyle, an Osage whose family owns oil headrights, via his day job as a cab driver. A romance develops, and the two marry in a ceremony mixing Roman Catholic and Osage traditions. Over time, they raise three children.
Hale secretly orders the contract killings of multiple wealthy Osage. He explains that Ernest will inherit more headrights if more of Mollie's family dies. Mollie is diabetic, and her mother Lizzie is ill. After Mollie's sister Minnie dies of a mysterious illness, Hale orders Byron to kill Mollie's other sister, the rebellious Anna. Lizzie and the Osage council blame the reservation's white residents and urge the tribe to fight back.
A newsreel of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, in which white people destroyed a black community and killed numerous residents, causes further concern amongst the Osage that they could suffer similarly. Lizzie sees her ancestors welcome her to the afterlife as she dies. Hale orders Ernest to arrange the murder of Henry Roan, Mollie's first husband. However, Ernest botches the assassination and Hale paddles him inside a Masonic Temple as punishment.
Since Hale is the local political boss, and both the local sheriff and judges are in his pocket, no investigations are made. An Osage Nation representative seeking to lobby Congress is murdered in Washington, D.C., while private detective William J. Burns, who was discreetly hired by Mollie, is attacked by Ernest and Byron, who run him off of the reservation.
Hale orders Ernest to murder Mollie's last surviving sister Reta and her husband Bill by having criminal Acie Kirby blow up their house. As the last surviving member of her family, Mollie inherits their headrights. Despite her illness, she travels to Washington with an Osage delegation and asks President Calvin Coolidge for help. Because of this, Hale orders Ernest to poison Mollie's insulin to ""slow her down"". Mollie's condition worsens, and Ernest exhibits similar symptoms after ingesting the poison himself.
Due to Mollie's lobbying, the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) sends Agent Thomas Bruce White Sr. and assistants to investigate; they quickly discover the truth. Hale tries to cover his tracks by murdering his own hitmen, including Acie, but White arrests Hale and Ernest. While Ernest is being interrogated, two agents are sent to question Mollie and find her near death. They rush her to the hospital where the doctors discover that she has been repeatedly poisoned and quickly notify White and the other agents. Mollie recovers under the care of the staff.
White persuades Ernest to confess and turn state's evidence against his uncle. W. S. Hamilton, Hale's attorney, tries to convince Ernest to claim he was tortured and recant. However, after one of his daughters dies of whooping cough, Ernest testifies against his uncle, wanting to be around for his remaining family. Hale unsuccessfully tries to have his nephew murdered. Mollie meets with Ernest after he testifies, and leaves him after he refuses to admit to poisoning her.
A radio drama years later reveals the aftermath: The Shoun brothers, who gave Ernest the poison for Mollie and were implicated in other ""wasting deaths"", were never prosecuted due to lack of evidence. Byron served no prison time due to a hung jury.[c]. Hale and Ernest were sentenced to life imprisonments. Both were paroled after years of incarceration, despite Osage protests to the parole board. Mollie divorced Ernest, married a man named John Cobb, and died of diabetes in 1937 at the age of 50. She was buried with her parents, sisters and daughter. Her obituary did not mention the Osage murders. The film closes with an overhead view of a 21st-century Osage powwow dancing circle.

254,Pain Hustlers,"In 2011, Liza Drake is a struggling single mother living out of her sister's garage in Florida with her epileptic daughter Phoebe. Working as an exotic dancer, she is offered a lucrative job by customer Pete Brenner.
An argument over money leads to Liza and Phoebe getting kicked out, so they move into a motel. When her car is repossessed, Liza finds Pete at pharmaceutical company Zanna to accept the job. She doesn't know the start-up is struggling, with difficulty breaking into the market and desperately scrambling for investors to fund a marketing push ahead of the planned IPO.
Pete rewrites Liza's dismal resume, giving her a degree in biochemistry. She impresses the company founder, Doctor Jack Neel, who overrides their hiring freeze. Pete gives her five days to convince a physician to prescribe their drug, Lonafen.
Liza goes through the entire list of prospects in under five days without any success. Meanwhile, Phoebe experiences a seizure and they learn she has CAVM. Thinking the job is over, Liza returns to Dr. Lydell's office, her first sales attempt, to collect some Tupperware and overhears a cancer patient discussing a commonly prescribed drug's side effects.
Liza argues that Lonafen would be a better option, so Lydell prescribes it. She invites him to launch their speaker program by sharing his experience with the drug's efficacy. The event fails and he nearly withdraws despite his patient praising the drug, but Liza gets the program on track. When Pete offers financial incentives, Lydell prescribes Lonafen to all eligible patients. Based on this success, they hire a team of sales reps and Zanna wins 86% of the regional market.
Larkin tries to expose Liza as a fraud for her doctored resume but Neel promotes her to National Sales Director and Pete to COO, who then fires Larkin. The profitable company moves into larger offices where Neel's eccentricities manifest more clearly. When CEO Eric Paley is found to be secretly recording an executive meeting, he is fired but cashes in big on his shares. As growth flattens, Neel pressures the team to market Lonafen for all types of pain, not just cancer. Liza disagrees with this, but Neel dismisses her. He also instructs Liza to fire her mother Jackie as a rep, after he slept with her.
Liza approaches Lydell with her new marching orders and is disappointed when he readily agrees to go along. Meanwhile, Phoebe experiences another seizure and requires expensive brain surgery. Although Liza offers her stock options in Zanna as collateral for a loan, she is denied because of the pharma sector's volatility. After Lydell is arrested in a DEA sting, a desperate Liza asks Neel for help paying for the surgery but he exhorts her to use Phoebe's situation as ""fire"" for inspiration, like he did when his wife was dying from cancer and he came up with Lonafen.
When a friend's husband dies from a Lonafen overdose and her condolences are rejected, Liza agrees to testify to the U.S. Attorney's office that's investigating Zanna. She admits her involvement in Zanna's speaker and bribery programs. Liza confirms who signed off on those programs: Eric Paley, Pete Brenner, and Jack Neel. Asked to come up with hard proof linking Neel to the criminal activity, she explains that he has completely insulated himself from daily operations.
After Liza unsuccessfully attempts to procure a printout from Pete's jacket, he is arrested, though Neel offers to take care of his family while he's in prison. Neel himself remains seemingly untouchable until Liza links him to Zanna's illegal activities via an old email exchange during his affair with her mother.
The investigation reveals that Lonafen is essentially fentanyl, which is why non-terminal patients became addicts and often overdosed. Lydell, Paley, Brenner, and Neel all receive prison sentences. After a heartfelt apology in court and the prosecution's recommendation that Liza not serve time in order not to discourage future whistleblowers, she is still sentenced to 15 months, as her greed cost lives.
After Liza's release, she partners with some of the previous Zanna reps to form the skin care company she and Jackie had envisioned years ago.

255,Nyad (film),"In 2010, sixty-year-old Diana Nyad resolves to accomplish the one thing that has eluded her—a 110-mile nonstop swim from Cuba to Florida, which she had unsuccessfully attempted thirty years prior. She appoints her best friend and former partner, Bonnie Stoll, to train her. Despite public skepticism because of her age, Diana relocates to Key West with Bonnie for her training and hires navigator John Bartlett to accompany her on her swim. In lieu of a shark cage, Diana opts to swim with a Shark Shield, a shark repellant electronic device.
In August 2011, Diana makes her first attempt at swimming the Florida Straits since 1978. However, unfavorable ocean currents pushing her off course force her to quit early. On her second attempt a month later, she gets stung by box jellyfish. The lead medic jumps in to save her, but he is also ensnared by the jellyfish and has to be rescued. A shot is administered to Diana for the venom, but she insists on continuing to swim with her injury. After some initial resistance, Bonnie and John oblige her, but Diana gets stung again and briefly loses consciousness. She is resuscitated on the boat.
Diana recovers in a hospital, where Bonnie expresses her worry to Diana about the severity of the dangers and warns her she is letting her personal dream overtake the safety of the boat crew. Diana pleads for another try and consults with a box jellyfish expert, who gives her a specially designed protective suit. Diana’s swims and training are interspersed with flashbacks that show her upbringing and her sexual abuse at the hands of her childhood swimming coach, Jack Nelson.
In August 2012, Diana makes another attempt, despite warnings from John about bad weather conditions. A thunderstorm breaks out during Diana’s swim and John’s boat starts to flood. Bonnie calls for Diana to abort the mission, despite Diana’s pleas to keep going. Back on land, Diana refuses to admit defeat and plans for another try, prompting a fight between her and Bonnie. Bonnie calls out Diana’s self-centeredness and laments how she has put aside her own dreams just to support Diana, before quitting as trainer.
Some time later, Diana calls John and apologizes for her behavior. John accepts the apology but admits he can’t do another run because of more pressing concerns, including financial stability. Diana visits Bonnie and the two reconcile. Bonnie informs Diana that Nelson passed away, and the news compels Diana to reflect on her trauma. Bonnie later decides to train Diana again after realizing the closeness of their bond. John also returns as navigator; he discloses to Bonnie that he is in ill health and wants one last opportunity to see what Diana can do.
Diana begins her fifth attempt on August 31, 2013; this time she is helped by more favorable currents. Danger arises when a shark approaches and the Shark Shield is not properly functioning. Assistants from the boat’s crew jump in the water in time to ward off the shark, which swims away. Hours later, Diana’s body is showing signs of exhaustion. She has hallucinatory visions of the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz and the Taj Mahal. To help motivate her, Bonnie jumps into the water and implores Diana to give it one last push. When the coastline of Key West is in sight, the crew excitedly informs Diana that they are getting closer.
On September 2, Diana makes it to the shore of Key West, where hordes of spectators and fans are gathered to watch. She emerges from the water and gradually ascends onto the beach, prompting celebrations from the crowd. Asked by the press to speak, Diana says she wants to say three things: ""One, never, ever give up. Two, you're never too old to chase your dreams. And three, it may look like a solitary sport…but it takes a team.""

256,Old Dads,"Jack Kelly, Connor Brody and Mike Richards have been friends and colleagues for decades. Now in their 50s, they struggle with the modern world and how they are expected to behave. For example, when Connor tries to get his son Colin (Dominic Grey Gonzalez) to apologize for hitting people, his wife Cara reprimands him. Deciding to sell their business Trifecta to some millennials, but kept on as employees, they are shocked when the hipster new boss Aspen fires everyone over 35 except them. Moving away from simply selling throwback team jerseys, the company is modernizing, becoming both gender- and carbon-neutral.
Jack gets publicly chewed out by the director of his son Nate's pre-school for being two minutes late and responds with the coarsest of vulgarities. His wife, Leah, forces him to apologize, as a recommendation will be needed from her for private kindergarten admission, and she points out he has anger management issues. When Jack and Leah go to the school to apologize to the director, she makes him do it to the group of parents and kids. A few pinpoint the specifics that upset them, he apologizes for each. However, Leah points out Jack must continue to be on his best behavior for the next three months so the director gives Nate a recommendation.
Meanwhile, divorcé and father of two adult sons Mike arrives home to a surprise. Although he had had a vasectomy, his young girlfriend Britney divulges that she is pregnant. Later, the three friends meet at the bar and Jack and Connor try to get him to look on the bright side.
As Jack has been asked to organize the school fundraiser, he and Connor are made to feel marginalized by the millennials. Then, the three friends are sent to find Ed Cameron, a man who has chosen to be off-grid since the 1980s, to convince him to represent the company. Travis (Justin Miles), one of the young employees, accompanies them. As the old friends banter, he calls them misogynistic. Mike calls him out for his superior attitude, proving through his love of modern music that he is not always politically correct either. When they hit an armadillo, Ed comes to collect it.
Meanwhile, Leah comes across Cara. Colin walks up and hits her pregnant stomach. When she warns him, he blatantly punches it. Cara defends him and the women argue. At Trifecta, although the trio were successful recruiting Cameron, Aspen fires them as a hidden camera in the rental car caught their misogynistic banter. Even Travis is sacked, as his TV camera captured him singing strongly worded rap lyrics as he started his day.
Afterwards, Mike cuts off ties with Jack; Connor is not allowed to have contact because of Cara's anger at the Kellys, so Jack focuses on the school fundraiser. Everything goes well until he has another blow up, resulting in Leah kicking him out. Jack and Mike coincide in a late-night eatery. They make peace, then pick up Connor for a casino bachelor party road-trip, as Britney insists they marry. They come across Aspen, who has been fired for accidentally using politically incorrect jargon and dumped. Later, at a strip club, Jack gets a call that Leah is in labor. Drunk, they are forced to get an Uber. Excruciatingly slow, they end up grabbing small electric scooters to complete the journey.
Missing the birth, Jack still makes up with Leah and vows to go to therapy. In the end, they opt for public school for Nate and Jack has learned to control his temper. Mike proposes to Britney properly and Connor gets Cara to lighten up.

257,Butcher's Crossing (film),"In 1874, Will Andrews, the naive son of a pastor, has dropped out of Harvard and travels to Butcher's Crossing, a tiny frontier town in Kansas built on the buffalo hide trade. He wishes to see as much of the country as he can and experience the Wild West. Sold on the romanticism of going on a buffalo hunt, Will seeks out McDonald, a former acquaintance of his father's, who currently runs the waning buffalo trade for the town. When McDonald refuses to oblige the young man, Will falls in with Miller, an intense and experienced buffalo hunter who spins him a tale of a remote Colorado pass where one of the few remaining massive herds can be found. Though warned about Miller and the folly of this enterprise, Will puts up all of his money to fund the expedition.
With Will's money, they purchase supplies and hire Charlie Hoge, a drunk, one armed, bible-thumper, to be wagon driver and camp cook, and Fred Schneider, a crude, but pragmatic, 'skinner' who insists on being paid a salary due to his doubts about Miller's stories.
The journey to the pass is difficult for Will, who is thrilled and enchanted with the scenery, but unused to rigorous hardships. The team encounters many difficulties which make them doubt the veracity of Miller's claim and ability to lead them, and Will's sanity begins to falter, but eventually they reach the mountain pass to discover an untouched herd with thousands upon thousands of buffalo. Will is ecstatic and awed, believing the beautiful nature surrounding them is ""God"", elated at being able to experience something so beautiful.
Miller begins his hunt. What starts as a thrilling adventure soon becomes an obsessive, methodical onslaught of endless slaughter. Miller revels in dropping hundreds of buffalo a day, leaving Will and Schneider scrambling to skin the carcasses, with Miller refusing to slow down his kills. The ceaseless rounds of blood and butchery wear on Will and his mental and physical health, as he begins to feel their presence is corrupting the sacred space of the pass. He becomes numb to the gore as time passes and the valley becomes filled with skinned corpses.
After three weeks of constant butchery, Schneider points out that they have overstayed their intended time and already have more hides than they can carry. He proposes they stop and return before the weather turns and they become trapped. Miller refuses. He is obsessed and won't stop until every buffalo in the herd is dead. Will sides with Miller and the team stays to continue the slaughter despite Schneider's protests at the pointless waste of killing more than they can carry.
Predictably, the team becomes trapped by a blizzard. They are now forced to live out the winter in the mountains. They are low on food, because they have killed all but a handful of the buffalo and left the previous carcasses to rot. Schneider is frustrated at becoming trapped because they wouldn't listen, and lashes out at Hoge, who has descended into paranoid religious mutterings. In revenge, Hoge poisons Schneider's food. Will's sanity slips further, and Miller obsesses over the triumph of returning to town with the largest haul ever seen once he's killed every single buffalo. The team settles in to endure a long, boring slog of survival as they wait the winter out.
When spring comes, Hoge is killed after the poisoning is discovered, and the team is antsy to return. Unable to haul all of the 4,600 hides they have collected, they pile 1,600 in their wagon, and leave the remaining 3,000 with the intent to return for them. An exultant Miller is impatient to return to the town, triumphant with his haul, but their damaged wagon falls off a cliff, taking Scheider and the 1,600 hides with it, as Miller and Will numbly stare on.
Will and Miller rush to town, hoping to get another wagon in order to return for the 3,000 remaining hides. But Butcher's Crossing is much changed. Largely abandoned and derelict, the pair are horrified to learn that the bottom has fallen out of the buffalo hide market while they were trapped for the winter. Had they returned the previous fall, as intended, instead of been greedy and stayed until every buffalo was killed, they could have sold their hides and become immensely wealthy. Now, with no buyers, the hides are completely worthless, and the town collapsed once its main source of commerce dried up.
Robbed of his victory, Miller sets the old buffalo exchange building on fire.
A much-changed Will says he has ""seen what [he] needed to see"" on the buffalo hunt when asked if the experience was worth it, and rides into the wilderness, alone.

258,The Other Zoey,"Zoey Miller, a highly intelligent computer major junior, at Queens University of Charlotte does not believe in the traditional concept of romantic love, but rather that having similar ways of thinking is the key. On Valentine's Day she speaks up against fellow student Becca's presentation on Saint Valentine in a history class, saying that the holiday is a capitalist creation. She has designed an app that will effectively match people based on algorithms.
As Zoey is crossing campus with her roommate and friend Elle, the school's soccer star Zach MacLaren accidentally launches a ball into her head. He rushes over, apologizing and offers to take her to get her head looked at. Elle sees it as a kind of meet-cute, but Zoey shrugs it off. In a subsequent class, a dark-haired guy has an almost identical view as Zoey when another professor brought up love, but disappears before she can tell him so.
Binge watching rom-coms with Elle in honor of the day, Zoey's mom Paula calls, and she reiterates her dislike of the genre, in disagreement with the others. She considers them to be formulaic and contrived.
Zach comes into the campus bookstore where Zoey works, and they banter in a mutually insulting way. Forgetting his credit card after ordering a book, she runs after him as he speeds off on his bike, and he crashes into a backing car. Zoey is the first person Zach sees when he comes to, and as he hears her name, he mistakes her for his girlfriend, who is coincidentally named Zoey too.
Asked by the EMT to accompany Zach to the hospital as Zoey's presence calms him, she bumps into his parents at the hospital. They also confuse her for his girlfriend, but as he has amnesia no one realizes the error. The doctor tells Zoey to avoid upsetting Zach until he recovers, so his parents have her to dinner. She meets Zach's little sister Avery and his cousin Miles, the guy she'd seen with similar views as her from the lecture. She continues to discover things she has in common with him. They invite her along for a family ski weekend, so she cancels her flight to see Paula to join them.
As Zach has to stay in the rented house to rest, Zoey goes to the slopes where Miles teaches her to snowboard. They are mutually attracted so, that night in the hot tub as they are alone briefly, they kiss. In the morning when Zach mentions Miles' girlfriend, she confronts him, but he explains they have a polyamorous relationship.
Disappointed, Zoey chooses to spend the day keeping Zach company. As he must avoid screens, they play games like Jenga and chess. Zach even shows his culinary skills by preparing a gourmet pizza with her. By the end of the day, Zoey feels a bond with him, saying that she hopes he remembers how well this day was once his amnesia is gone.
Riding back to the MacLarens', the soccer playing Zoey arrives, accusing Zoey of identity theft. She is able to explain the circumstances, and apologizes for deceiving them. As Zoey leaves, Avery blurts out that she prefers her to soccer Zoey.
Back in class, outlandish rumors circulate about Zoey, and she's videoed lashing out at the negative attention. Later, she lashes out at Elle, upset that she'd convinced her to lie for so long. Fed up, Zoey goes to her mom's. Paula makes her realize that she needs to be brave and go after what she wants.
Returning to her college, Zoey writes Elle an apology poem and they make up. Then Becca proposes she help them promote the upcoming Jam Fest to recover her image. They'd like her to set up a web page with geotags and simultaneous multiple video feeds.
Successfully getting the website up and running after an all-nighter, Zoey plans on watching from home in her pjs. However, Elle drags her to the Jam Fest before it finishes, as Zach is there and is likely available. Throwing her coat over her pjs, she stops the music to find him. Once she does, Zoey confesses her feelings, Zach admits he broke up with soccer Zoey because of his feelings and they kiss.

Mike's career counselor, Steve Raglan, offers him a job as a night guard at Freddy's. Though initially reluctant, Mike accepts after social services threaten to take custody of his younger sister Abby and pass her to their estranged aunt, Jane, who desires the custody's monthly payments.
During his first night on the job, Mike falls asleep and dreams about the kidnapping of his little brother, Garrett. He meets five children who also witnessed the crime, but flee when he approaches them. The following day, Jane hires a gang of vandals, which includes Abby's babysitter Max, and is led by Max's brother Jeff, to vandalize the restaurant to get Mike fired and hasten Jane's custody of Abby. At Mike's shift that night, he meets police officer Vanessa Shelly, who explains that Freddy's closed during the 1980s after five children were murdered there. The suspect and the victims' bodies were never found. Once Mike's shift ends and he leaves, the vandals break in, but the restaurant's animatronic mascots—Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Mr. Cupcake—kill the entire group. Max's disappearance forces Mike to bring Abby along on his next shift, in which the animatronics befriend Abby and Mike discovers that the animatronics are possessed by the amnesiac ghosts of the missing children, whose leader consistently mentions a ""yellow rabbit"".
On the fourth night, Abby is accidentally injured when she, Mike, and Vanessa are bonding with the animatronics. The next morning, Mike gets Jane to babysit a frustrated Abby as he goes back to Freddy's and takes some sleeping pills. The children appear in his dream again and tell him that he can stay with Garrett forever in exchange for Abby; Mike initially accepts, but when he changes his mind, he is attacked. After being strapped to the device that killed the previous guard and narrowly escaping, Mike is cornered and injured by Foxy. Meanwhile, a damaged yellow Freddy animatronic,[a] possessed by the leader of the children, presumably kills Jane and takes Abby back to the pizzeria.
Vanessa treats Mike's injuries and reveals that she is the daughter of William Afton, the serial killer who kidnapped and murdered the five children and Garrett. He hid their bodies in the animatronics, knowing that the police would never search them, and now, their souls are under his control. Realizing that the animatronics plan to kill Abby and have her join them, Mike rushes to the restaurant. The animatronics are defeated but are reactivated by Steve, who arrives wearing the ""yellow rabbit"" suit,[b] and reveals himself to be William.
Knowing the animatronics like drawings, Abby draws a picture of William murdering the children to free them from his influence and make them realize the truth. Vanessa attempts to stop William, but he stabs her. When the animatronics see Abby's drawing, they turn on William. Mr. Cupcake bites off part of William's suit, triggering its internal springlock mechanisms, which fatally wound him. As the animatronics drag William away, Mike and Abby carry Vanessa out of the collapsing restaurant, who later falls into a coma and is hospitalized. Shortly after, Mike and Abby reconcile and resume their normal lives.

263,The Killer (2023 film),"A professional assassin stakes out a Parisian hotel room. He prepares to use a sniper rifle to kill a target who will check into the hotel room at an unspecified time. While waiting for the target, he eats, practices yoga, listens to The Smiths, and talks on the phone with his handler, an attorney, and his former university law professor, Edward ""Eddie"" Hodges. The target arrives with a dominatrix and the Killer misses his target, accidentally shooting the dominatrix. He flees on an e-scooter, evading the police and disposing of his rifle and gear. He then flies to the United States under fake identities.
The Killer returns to his home and hideout in the Dominican Republic to find it has been broken into and his girlfriend Magdala has been attacked. She is in an intensive care unit of a hospital, with her brother watching over her. He says that Magdala was interrogated and tortured by two assassins but managed to injure one of them and escape. The Killer tracks down the taxi driver, Leo, who drove the assassins to the Killer's home. Leo identifies one of the assassins, a strong man with an injured leg; ""The Brute"", and a woman who ""resembled a Q-Tip"". The Killer kills Leo, and he breaks his ""Fight only the battle you're paid to fight"" rule and seeks to track down the two assassins.
The Killer travels to Hodges' office in New Orleans, Louisiana, and enters the building disguised as a custodial worker. After forcing Dolores, Hodges' secretary, to restrain her boss and herself, the Killer destroys the records of their work. As Hodges attempts to get the Killer to leave, the Killer shoots him in the chest with a nail gun to torture the names of the hitmen out of him. However, Hodges doesn't reveal the names and dies quicker than the Killer anticipated. Dolores offers to show the Killer the assassins' identities in her paper files in her home, asking in return that the Killer give her a non-suspicious death so her children can claim a life insurance payout. After receiving the names at her home, the Killer breaks his rule not to show empathy; he snaps her neck and shoves her down a flight of stairs, making the fall look like an accident. He later disposes of Hodges' body on a ship.
Afterwards, the Killer drives to St. Petersburg, Florida, identifying the Brute by his limp. After drugging his pit bull, the Killer enters his house to kill him, only to be blindsided and tackled. They engage in a fight, and the Brute recognizes the Killer. The Killer shoots him and runs from his reawakened dog, burning down his home with a Molotov cocktail.
The Killer travels to Beacon, New York, and confronts The Expert ""Q-Tip"" assassin in a gourmet restaurant. Appearing to accept her fate, The Expert questions the Killer's motivations in continuing and lessening competency in his profession, as they partake in her ""last supper"" of whiskey. In a park outside, The Expert appears to trip on the stairs and requests the Killer to give her a hand. The Killer, instead, kills her and notices she had a concealed knife in her hand.
The Killer travels to Chicago, where the client, billionaire venture capitalist Henderson ""Clay"" Claybourne, lives in an upscale penthouse. The Killer transfers all of his finances to the Dominican Republic under the name Jefferson and observes Claybourne's routine. The Killer then uses tools purchased online to clone Claybourne's keycard and enter his penthouse. The Killer confronts Claybourne at gunpoint in his penthouse, asking him why he ordered the retaliatory hit. Claybourne claims that he has no personal problem with him and, as a first-time client of a hitman, agreed to pay Hodges for ""the trail to be scrubbed"". The Killer spares Claybourne, though promising him a ""slow death"" if Claybourne ever comes for him. Later, The Killer returns to the Dominican Republic and sits next to a recovering Magdala.

264,Under the Boardwalk (2023 film),"A community of land hermit crabs underneath a New Jersey beach boardwalk often play host to a community of sea hermit crabs that come to the land for vacation and both species of crabs can't stand each other. Armen, a timid land crab, is reluctant to go out and socialize due to how his mother and father died in a storm when he was younger and his rotting shell, inhabited by a fun-loving organism named Anemone, is the only reminder of them. However, three muscular crabs and Armen's friends, Bobby, Manny and Jimmy, drag him to a club owned by his uncle Bruno. The crabs get into a fight with an arrogant sea crab named Mako when Armen inadvertently bumps into Ramona, a tourist sea crab he fell in love with earlier. The land crabs get evicted as a result and Armen frustratedly takes his leave. As he is sulking by the seashore, Mako and his goons come to hassle him and steal his shell. Ramona intervenes, but she and Armen get swept away in a high tide that ruins the land crab civilization.
Armen ends up in the far end of the beach and above the boardwalk where he is captured by a human collector to sell as a pet and is given an artificial shell to boot. He soon reunites with Ramona and together, they escape and work together to get back home. On their journey, they each share their insecurities, Armen for being too frightened to do anything besides stay in his shell and Ramona from wanting to get away from her overbearing mother Val, who expects perfection from her. Armen and Ramona's disappearances soon intensifies the rivalry between the land and sea crabs, mostly due to how Mako made up the story of how Armen tried to steal Ramona way from him. Bobby begins second-guessing his tendency to use physical force against his enemies and soon encounters Ramona's deaf sister Shelly looking for Ramona. However, as he walks her home, Val sends him away and when he tries to break up a fight between his friends and Mako's gang, he accidentally snaps off Mako's right arm. Mako vows revenge and claims that Armen is dead, giving them Armen's shell and a shell-shocked Anemone. The land crabs then declare war.
As Armen and Ramona fall in love, two of the crabs they met while at the pet shop begin judging them, making Armen feel hesitant about his feelings, much to Ramona's distress. Eventually, Ramona begins to get dehydrated and passes out, prompting Armen to carry her into the water, moving past the conflict between the land and sea crabs, who cease their fighting to see Armen carrying Ramona and dragging her into the water. Ramona wakes up and kisses Armen and they go back to the surface where Armen is praised for his heroism and Mako is outed as a liar. The land and sea crabs work past their differences with Mako giving Bobby a new shell as a peace offering and Armen giving his shell to a new crab who needs it more.

265,Priscilla (film),"In 1959, 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu is residing with her family in Bad Nauheim, West Germany, where her father is stationed in the U.S. Military. At a party on the base, Priscilla meets 24-year-old renowned singer Elvis Presley, who has been drafted into the military at the peak of his fame. Elvis takes an immediate interest in Priscilla, and the two begin casually dating despite her parents' concern over their age difference and Elvis's celebrity status. Elvis eventually returns to the United States after his service and loses contact with Priscilla, leaving her crestfallen.
In 1962, Elvis reconnects with Priscilla, proclaiming his love for her, and asks that she come to the U.S. to live with him at Graceland, his estate in Memphis, Tennessee. Elvis purchases Priscilla airfare to make a visit, during which she is welcomed by Elvis, his friends and business partners, and his beloved grandmother. The couple take a trip to Las Vegas, where Priscilla indulges in prescription drug abuse with Elvis. A disheveled Priscilla returns to Germany, and, with Elvis' help, convinces her reluctant parents to allow her to move to Graceland and complete her senior year of high school in Memphis in 1963.
While her time spent with Elvis at Graceland is pleasant, Priscilla is treated as an object of fascination and derision at her Catholic high school due to her association with him. Though she is welcomed by Elvis's grandmother and his staff at Graceland, Priscilla soon finds herself controlled by Elvis's gruff father and stepmother, and isolated during Elvis's lengthy trips away to Los Angeles, where he is shooting a number of musical comedies. On one occasion, Elvis has Priscilla model dresses for him and his friends, and urges her to revamp her appearance by dying her hair black and donning fake eyelashes. Distracted by the new conditions of her life, Priscilla narrowly manages to graduate high school.
Priscilla's isolation and compartmentalization of her life begins to take a toll on her mental state, which is worsened by the highly publicized rumors of Elvis's alleged infidelities, including with his co-star Ann-Margret. Priscilla makes an unexpected appearance in Los Angeles to confront Elvis about the affair, but is defeated when Elvis threatens her and insists that she must learn to accept his behavior.
Eventually, in 1967, Elvis proposes to Priscilla, and the two marry. Their happiness is fleeting, however, as Elvis's career pressures and worsening substance abuse negatively affects the couple's relationship. Priscilla quickly becomes pregnant, and gives birth to their child, Lisa Marie, in early 1968, as Elvis is preparing for his NBC comeback special. Priscilla struggles to navigate the relationship as Elvis grows increasingly emotionally volatile, and the two eventually begin leading separate lives, with Priscilla spending most of her time in California, and becoming romantically involved with Mike Stone, her karate instructor.
While visiting Elvis in his hotel room after a performance in 1973, Priscilla finds him inebriated, and he makes forceful sexual advances toward her. She later informs him that she is filing for divorce. After making a visit to Graceland and saying goodbye to Elvis's housekeepers and grandmother, Priscilla drives away, as a number of Elvis's fans loiter outside the property gates.

266,The Holdovers,"In December 1970, Paul Hunham is an authoritarian classics professor at Barton Academy, a New England boarding school that he once attended on scholarship. His students and fellow teachers despise him for his brutally honest grading and difficult personality. Barton's headmaster, Woodrup, scolds Hunham for having cost the academy an important donor by giving the donor's son a failing grade, which led to the donor's son having his offer from Princeton University rescinded.
As punishment, Hunham is forced to supervise the ""holdover"" students left on campus for the holidays, including Angus Tully, whose mother abruptly cancelled a family trip to Saint Kitts to honeymoon with her new husband. Also staying behind is cafeteria administrator Mary Lamb, who is grieving the loss of her son, a Barton alumnus killed serving in the Vietnam War.
To their chagrin, Hunham imposes studying and exercise on the holdovers' break. After six days, the wealthy father of one of them arrives by helicopter and agrees to take all the students on the family's ski trip. Angus, unable to reach his parents for permission, is left alone at Barton with Hunham and Mary. After Hunham catches Angus trying to book a hotel room, Angus runs through the school halls while Hunham chases him. Angus defiantly leaps into a pile of gym equipment, dislocating his shoulder. At the hospital, Angus lies to protect Hunham from blame. Hunham later flirts with Lydia Crane, the assistant to the headmaster, after he and Angus encounter her at a restaurant, and she invites the pair to her Christmas Eve party.
On Christmas Eve, Angus, Hunham, Mary, and Barton's janitor, Danny, attend Lydia's party. While Angus spends time with Lydia's niece, Elise, Hunham is disappointed to discover that Lydia has a boyfriend, and Mary gets drunk and has an emotional breakdown over her son's death. Hunham insists on leaving early. While arguing with Hunham, Angus angrily shouts that his father is dead, causing Mary to lambast Hunham for his unsympathetic approach.
Having reflected on his behavior, Hunham puts together a small Christmas celebration, and with Mary's persuasion, grants Angus's wish for a ""field trip"" to Boston. After dropping Mary off in Roxbury to spend time with her pregnant sister, Angus and Hunham bond over various activities in Boston, including ice skating and a visit to the Museum of Fine Arts. They bump into one of Hunham's classmates from Harvard University, who has become a successful academic. When prompted, Hunham lies about his career, and Angus plays along. Hunham reluctantly confesses to Angus that he was expelled from Harvard after deliberately hitting a colleague, a legacy donor's son who framed him for plagiarism, with a car. After the incident ruined Hunham's career prospects, a connection to a teacher at Barton allowed him to secure a teaching position there.
When Hunham and Angus go to see Little Big Man at the Orpheum Theatre, Angus sneaks away and Hunham catches him entering a taxi. Angus explains he wants to see his father, and Hunham agrees to accompany him, assuming they are going to a cemetery. However, Angus's father is still alive and confined in a psychiatric hospital due to mental health issues and violent outbursts. Following the visit, Angus expresses concern that he will turn out like his father; Hunham comforts him and sincerely declares that Angus has a bright future. They join Mary and Danny to celebrate New Year's Eve.
When school resumes in January 1971, Hunham is summoned by Lydia to Woodrup's office, and finds Angus's mother and stepfather there as well. They tell Hunham that Angus's visit to the psychiatric hospital was unauthorized and that the snow globe Angus had given his father led to another violent outburst. Angus's mother and stepfather plan to send Angus to military school, but Hunham defends Angus and takes the blame for the trip. While Hunham is subsequently fired, Angus is allowed to stay at Barton.
Mary, who has come to better terms with the loss of her son, gives Hunham a notebook for the monograph he wants to write. Hunham and Angus share a poignant goodbye. Leaving the school, Hunham drinks from a bottle of cognac he stole from Woodrup, then spits some of it out toward the school and drives away.

267,Fingernails (film),"Some years prior to the film, a test costing one fingernail that determines whether couples were truly in love was developed. However, the test has caused mostly negative results, which lead to an increase in couples breaking up and divorcing.
Unemployed schoolteacher Anna gets a job as an instructor at the Love Institute, a one-year-old company founded by a man named Duncan, where researchers and instructors have couples undergo relationship-strengthening exercises to help them pass the test. Duncan believes that continued research will be beneficial, hoping for more positive test results. Anna initially keeps her hiring a secret from her boyfriend Ryan, with whom she has previously passed the test.
Anna shadows Amir, a fellow instructor, and develops a rapport with him as they guide clients through the exercises. Though Amir claims he and his girlfriend Natasha have also passed the test, his fondness for Anna is apparent. Meanwhile, Anna secretly does experiments and exercises with an oblivious Ryan to test their love. She eventually confesses about her job to Ryan, explaining that she feared that taking the job would strain their relationship, though it clearly does.
After Anna first performs the test on a promising client couple, she is shaken and disappointed when the result is negative, to which Amir tells her that she'll get used to it. At a workplace party, Amir's girlfriend Natasha is confused when Anna brings up his being gluten-intolerant, causing Anna to question if she and Amir have mutual feelings for each other.
Another day, Amir rips out his own fingernail to comfort a client nervous about the procedure. The client couple gets a positive result, delighting everyone. Seeing the opportunity, Anna secretly tests Amir's fingernail with her own. The result is a 50%, meaning one person is more in love with the other. When she asks Duncan if a person can have a positive result with two different people, he rejects her hypothesis. She later convinces a hesitant Ryan to take the test with her again, and they pass.
The next day, Anna confesses her findings to Amir, who confirms his feelings for her when she speculates that he is in love with her but she doesn't love him. Later that night, Anna and Amir kiss and sleep together. She expresses hesitancy about continuing her relationship with Ryan, stating, ""sometimes, being in love is lonelier than being alone.""
Amir admits that he started working at the Love Institute because he felt there was something wrong after never getting any positive test results. When Anna decides she wants to stay with him, Amir says they shouldn't be together and obey the test results, still confused by the situation. She stays over for the night, but she wakes up and decides to remove more of her fingernails in his kitchen out of heartbreak. Waking up and discovering this, Amir stops and comforts her. As they wait for her fingers to heal, they smile fondly at each other.

268,Suitable Flesh,"In a psychiatric hospital, Dr. Daniella Upton visits the morgue where the mortician is dissecting the body of an unseen figure, the victim of a brutal murder. Daniella visits the murderer, her friend Dr. Elizabeth Derby, who begs Daniella to destroy the brain of the corpse and begins to recount her story to explain why she must do so.
Psychiatrist Elizabeth Derby lives a near idyllic life with her husband Eddie, never being troubled by her patients. After a session with a patient, a young man arrives at her office and asks to talk to her; he introduces himself as Asa Waite and tells her that he believes his father is occasionally occupying his body. During the session, Asa receives a phone call from his father and appears to have a seizure before acting as if nothing happened, as well as behaving completely differently. Elizabeth is troubled by this development and that evening imagines Asa in Eddie's place while they are having sex. She goes to Asa's house, having remembered his address, and discovers his father Ephraim to be horribly sick, relying on pills to keep him alive; Ephraim wards Elizabeth off with a large knife after she spots a book with strange creatures and symbols drawn in it.
That night, Asa calls Elizabeth and she drives to his house, finding Ephraim dying on the floor; Asa refuses to let Elizabeth hand him his pills but Elizabeth defies his orders, though she isn't able to stop Ephraim's apparent death. Asa tells her that they must destroy Ephraim's brain because if he says an incantation a third time, he will take over Asa's body; Ephraim, revealed to be alive, utters the incantation and causes Asa to have a seizure before seemingly dying a second time. Asa, now more confident, has sex with Elizabeth and whispers an incantation in her ear which causes them to briefly switch bodies. He notices that Ephraim's body is missing, prompting him to take the elongated knife and chase after him. Ephraim begs Elizabeth to help him as he is actually Asa in Ephraim's body but the real Ephraim, now in Asa's body, stabs him in the neck with the knife before decapitating him.
The following day, two detectives stop by the Derby residence in order to question Elizabeth about a fire at the Waite house, with Ephraim being labeled as a missing person. Elizabeth talks to her friend, fellow psychiatrist, Daniella Upton, about the body-switch but Daniella doesn't understand what she means; later, Elizabeth admits to Eddie that she has had sex with Asa. Meanwhile, Ephraim (still in Asa's body) handcuffs himself to a pole in his cellar and calls Elizabeth, reading the incantation and causing the two to switch bodies. While in Elizabeth's body, Ephraim has sex with Eddie; Elizabeth discovers piles of flesh as well as drawings of a strange creature in the cellar. Realizing that the next body swap will be forever, Elizabeth attempts to jump out of a window at her office but Ephraim arrives and tells her that she can escape if she successfully kills him and destroys his brain. Upon distracting him, Elizabeth stabs him in the head with his knife before throwing him out of the window; realizing that he is still alive, Elizabeth runs Ephraim over repeatedly with her car before stabbing him to death. She is then apprehended by police officers.
In present day, the heavily mutilated corpse, now revealed to be Ephraim, awakens and utters the incantation one final time, causing him to switch bodies with Elizabeth. Elizabeth in the corpse's body begins to crawl through the hospital while Ephraim decides to switch bodies with Daniella, causing the two of them to fight. In Daniella's body, Ephraim begs a security guard named Mace to shoot Daniella but she manages to get his gun and euthanizes Elizabeth by shooting her in the head repeatedly. The two switch back and Ephraim shoots Mace to death before continuing to fight; Daniella gets ready to stab him with a scalpel as Ephraim recites the incantation again, before they are separated by police officers. Some time later, Daniella consoles Eddie in her office as Ephraim is revealed to be in control of her body while the real Daniella is trapped inside the body of a screaming Elizabeth.

272,Quiz Lady,"Anne, a tightly wound, game show-obsessed young woman, receives a call notifying her that her gambling addict mother has fled to Macau. This news reunites her with her estranged and reckless older sister, Jenny. Jenny, who had previously been living in her car, temporarily moves in with Anne. One night while Anne is watching her favorite game show, Can't Stop the Quiz, Jenny secretly records Anne answering every question at remarkable speed and uploads it online. The video goes viral overnight, drawing the attention of a loan shark to whom Anne and Jenny's mother owes $80,000. Tracking down Anne, he demands that she pay off her mother's debt and informs her that he has kidnapped her pet dog, Mr. Linguini, as ransom. Anne blames Jenny for the mishap and asks her to use money she won from a lawsuit against a restaurant chain to pay the ransom; however, Jenny reveals she lied about winning the case and that she cannot pay off the debt. Instead, she encourages Anne—whose video gained the attention of Can't Stop the Quiz casting directors—to go on the show and win enough money to get Mr. Linguini back.
Prior to the audition for the show, Jenny dislocates her wrist at a bar. While waiting at the doctors office and reminiscing about old times, Anne admits to defecating into a hole when staying at their cousins' house in Burbank one summer when they were younger, due to her being too uncomfortable and unwelcome to do so inside the house. Jenny comforts her, saying that the cousins never liked their side of the family anyway, claiming it to be the reason why they never stayed with them again. During the audition, Anne, initially nervous about being in front of a crowd of people, tries to leave before it begins, but Jenny gives her some calming pills that are later revealed to be hallucinogens. After being given other pills to calm the effects of the first one, Anne does well at the audition, impressing the crowd and the producers.
The next morning, Jenny congratulates Anne and reveals to her that this was all part of her plan to become a self-described life coach, stating that she lied about lying and really did have a large check coming in from her lawsuit and she tricked Anne because she knew that she would not have gone on the show without her thinking she had no other choice. Angered, Anne insults Jenny, to which the latter retaliates saying that she was the one that has always been looking out for her, bringing up the time when Anne defecated into the hole, revealing she did not dig the hole deep enough and the other cousins found it. Jenny covered for Anne, telling them that she was the one to do it and this was the reason they never allowed Jenny, Anne, and their mother to stay with them again.
Anne returns home and her cantankerous neighbor, Francine, invites her into her home for a cup of tea. Francine tells Anne that she has lived a long time and that worrying about and trying to get other people to like you is a waste of time. Anne receives a call saying that she has been invited to go onto Can't Stop the Quiz, and decides to go on the show with Francine as her partner. Meanwhile, Jenny negotiates with the loan sharks and eventually steals Mr. Linguini back. Anne shows strong disdain for Ron, the long-running returning champion on Can't Stop the Quiz, and finishes a distant second to him after the first round. When Jenny shows up with Mr. Linguini, she reconciles with and convinces Anne to finish the game, and persuades the producers to let Anne have the dog with her to calm her. After the second round, Anne is closely behind Ron. When the third round is chosen to be a game of charades, Anne switches partners and plays with Jenny instead of Francine. On the winning word, they share a heartfelt moment as Anne admits to Jenny that she is her hero.
Anne wins the game, and goes on to win 93 consecutive games, holding the record for longest streak. She is later hired as a writer on the show. Jenny's check comes in from her lawsuit and the two of them pay off their mother's debts. Jenny also purchases a Malibu mansion where Anne and Jenny now live together.

275,What Happens Later,"At an unnamed regional airport on Leap Day, ex-lovers Wilhelmina ""Willa"" Davis and William ""Bill"" Davis run into each other and make small talk during their layovers.
Willa and Bill are about to get on their respective flights; Willa is on her way to Boston and Bill is on his way to Austin. However, a storm, later identified as a bomb cyclone, causes flights at the airport to be delayed, leaving Willa and Bill to reconnect. Bill is married to his wife Beth-Anne and together they have a 15-year-old daughter, Rose, but Bill says that he and Beth-Anne are “going through a thing”. Rose also wishes to be a dancer, which worries Bill. Meanwhile, Willa plans to visit her friend Ginny, who is splitting up with her husband.
While Willa and Bill reminisce about their past relationship, it is revealed that Willa suffered a miscarriage while she was with Bill. After Bill left, Willa had a little girl with a man who left as soon as he found out she was pregnant. Willa later gave her daughter up for adoption, she was able to find the perfect parents, but Willa does not know where her daughter is now.
Bill mentions that he saw Willa a year prior while she was changing planes in Dallas, but Bill did not say anything to her, stating that she looked lost. Bill obtains a hotel voucher, but is unable to reserve a room. It is announced that Willa's flight to Boston is now boarding, but she ends up giving up her seat for a family. Willa tries to give Bill her ticket after upgrading to first class, so he will not miss Rose's recital, as both Bill and Willa are “W. Davis”. Bill refuses. Willa mentions that Beth-Anne called earlier while Bill was grabbing coffee to say that Rose does not want to stay with him, but with Beth-Anne instead for a few weeks. Bill then takes the ticket, only for all flights to suddenly be suspended.
Rose calls Bill and Bill encourages her to try her best at dancing; earlier, Bill told Willa about how he had told Rose that she would not make it as a professional dancer, making her sad. Willa tells Bill that she is actually going to Boston to meet her daughter. Maggie, who just turned 20, called Willa and told her that she would like to meet. Earlier, Willa, using Bill's phone, texted Maggie saying that she was not going to come. Maggie then replied, telling Willa to just try, initially, this was seen as Willa texting Ginny.
The next day, all outbound flights are then announced to be departing shortly. Willa gifts Bill with her rainstick and Bill gives Willa an old card, saying that he will write his number on the back. They then exchange a kiss, before leaving to board their flights. Willa turns Bill's card over, only to see that he only wrote ""just try"". Willa and Bill exchange final gestures through the windows of their planes, which are parked next to each other. Bill tries to sign his phone number to Willa, only for their flights to finally depart, as the contrails from the planes form a heart.

280,The Marvels,"Carol Danvers destroys the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that leads the Kree empire.[a] This leads to a civil war on planet Hala, the Kree home world, rendering the planet barren as it loses its air, water, and sunlight over the next 30 years.
The Kree's new leader Dar-Benn discovers one of the two legendary Quantum Bands, which were used to create a network that allows fast travel across space. She uses the Band to forcibly open a new jump point that connects to the network. The resulting anomaly impacts the entire network, including a jump point near Earth's S.A.B.E.R. space station run by Nick Fury. Captain Monica Rambeau investigates the jump point near S.A.B.E.R. while Danvers investigates the new one that Dar-Benn opened. When they touch their respective jump points, Rambeau is transported to Danvers' location, Kamala Khan—who has the other Quantum Band on Earth—is transported to Rambeau's location, and Danvers is transported to Kamala's house. The three use their different light-based powers to fight off Kree enemies, leaving the Khan family home destroyed.
After the trio return to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau surmises that their light-based powers are linked through quantum entanglement and that they switch places when any of the three use their powers simultaneously. They join up at a Skrull refugee colony on planet Tarnax, which Danvers helped found and where a peace treaty is being negotiated with the Kree. When talks break down, Dar-Benn rips open another jump point which siphons the atmosphere from Tarnax to restore breathable air to Hala. After a hasty effort to evacuate the colony, Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala form a team that Kamala names ""the Marvels"". Danvers explains that Dar-Benn's repeated rupturing of jump points is causing instability in the network and endangering the entire universe. They deduce that Dar-Benn is targeting planets that are meaningful to Danvers, whom Dar-Benn blames for the desolation of Hala.
The Marvels reach the water planet Aladna and warn the locals before Dar-Benn arrives and tears open a jump point, drawing the planet's water to Hala. Her final plan is to use the energy from Earth's sun to restore that of Hala's sun. Dar-Benn steals Kamala's Band and attempts to use both Bands, but this destroys Dar-Benn, ends the Marvels' entanglement, and leaves behind a rupture between realities. Kamala reclaims the Bands and joins Danvers to energize Rambeau, allowing her to close the hole from the other side but stranding her in the process. Kamala returns to Earth and Danvers flies into Hala's sun, using her power to restore it.
The short-lived team-up inspires Kamala to seek out other young heroes and form a new group, starting with Kate Bishop. In a mid-credits scene, Rambeau awakes in a parallel universe where she is greeted by Binary—an alternate version of her mother Maria—and the mutant scientist Hank McCoy.

281,Dream Scenario,"Paul Matthews is a mild-mannered biology professor who begins appearing in the dreams of random people. In the dreams, calamity occurs, but Paul is emotionless and does not intervene.
When Paul learns an old colleague is considering writing a book on a topic he has considered writing about, he cannot find the courage to confront her. Paul's journalist ex-girlfriend, Claire, spots him with his wife, Janet, and tells him he appears in her dreams. With his permission, she writes an article about the experience, and hundreds of strangers recognize him from their dreams. While Paul enjoys the media coverage this brings, he is frustrated by his depiction in the dreams as passive and uninteresting.
Paul's wife, Janet, asks why he does not appear in her dreams. She describes her fantasy: Paul rescues her while wearing the oversized suit worn by David Byrne in the 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense. A mentally ill man sees Paul in his dreams and breaks into the house with a knife, raising concerns about the risks of his fame.
Paul meets with a PR firm, hoping to get a book deal, but they attempt to convince him to advertise Sprite. After an assistant at the firm tells him about her erotic dreams about him, he attempts to reenact them for her, but he suffers premature ejaculation and flatulence and leaves humiliated.
Paul is enraged to learn that a former colleague has published a paper on the subject he was thinking of writing his book about. Paul's presence in the dreams becomes violent and sadistic, and he becomes vilified. He is put on leave after students refuse to enroll in his classes. Bystanders begin to notice Paul in public and are bothered by his presence, resulting in a brawl in a diner. After Janet's career is affected, she asks Paul to make a public apology, but he angrily refuses.
After Paul has a nightmare in which he is hunted and killed by a version of himself with a crossbow, he releases a self-pitying apology video. Humiliated, Janet throws him out of the house. Paul forces his way into his daughter's school play, but accidentally injures a teacher in the process and is restrained.
Some time later, the dreams have stopped. In light of the discovery of a shared subconsciousness, dreams have become an advertising space. Janet is separated from Paul and is dating a coworker. Paul goes on a book tour in France to sell his autobiography, Dream Scenario, which has been retitled Je suis ton cauchemar (""I Am Your Nightmare"") without his consent. He uses dream-travel technology to enter one of Janet's dreams and rescue her while wearing the Byrne suit. Paul wishes the dream were real and floats away.

284,It's a Wonderful Knife,"In the town of Angel Falls, teenager Winnie Carruthers is celebrating the Christmas season with her friends and family. During a party, Winnie witnesses her best friend Cara being murdered by a masked assailant known as ""The Angel"". Winnie and her brother Jimmy chase The Angel outside, where Winnie kills The Angel by electrocuting him with jumper cables. Winnie unmasks the killer and recognizes him as Henry Waters, a business partner of her father David.
One year later, Winnie is still grieving Cara's death, while her family has moved on from the events of the previous year. She attends a Christmas party at her boyfriend Robbie's house, where she befriends a social outcast named Bernie, before discovering that Robbie has been cheating on her with her friend Darla for a year. Distraught, Winnie goes alone to a bridge and, looking up at the aurora lights in the sky, wishes that she had never been born. Suddenly, the aurora disappears, and the town's power briefly goes out before returning. Winnie looks around in confusion, and after The Angel briefly chases her, she learns that the town's sheriff is now Henry's brother Buck, who claims he does not recognize her. She is then left speechless upon being greeted by Henry, who is now the town mayor. Winnie goes to see her family, who also do not recognize her, and she realizes she has been transported to an alternate reality in which she never existed, meaning that The Angel is still alive and has already killed several more people since the previous year, including Jimmy.
Upset, Winnie goes to Robbie's Christmas party and meets with Bernie, explaining her plight to her, despite her mild disbelief. After narrowly avoiding being killed by The Angel, Bernie and Winnie deduce The Angel has been killing the children of property owners who Henry wanted to buy from, thus disheartening them into letting the properties go. Winnie decides she needs her father's help to stop Henry and kill him again, and successfully convinces her aunt Gale of her situation by recounting an embarrassing personal detail only the family would know. Winnie tries to convince her father that Henry killed Jimmy, but David refuses to listen to her and demands that she leave. On her way out, Winnie witnesses the killer murdering her mother and a man she was having an affair with. The Angel then tries to attack Winnie, Bernie, and Gale, but is knocked out. Winnie unmasks the killer, shocked to find David behind the mask. David regains consciousness and the trio escapes. Winnie, Bernie, and Gale manage to kill David after luring him to the movie theater where Bernie works.
As Winnie and Bernie return to the bridge under the aurora lights, Bernie reveals that she was contemplating suicide and that Winnie saved her. Winnie wishes that she was born after all, but to her frustration, nothing seems to happen. She realizes that Henry still poses a danger to the town as mayor, and that he needs to die again before Winnie can return to her original timeline. Winnie and Bernie come across a rally being hosted by Henry where all the attendees appear to be in a trance. The two confront him and accuse him of the deaths of the past year. Henry confirms that he killed Jimmy, and in doing so broke David's spirit and placed him under his control, making him his accomplice. When Henry attacks Winnie, Bernie stabs him to death, breaking his control over the townspeople. As the aurora reappears, Winnie and Bernie kiss.
Winnie wakes up in her bedroom on Christmas morning. She cheerfully greets her family, and her parents apologize for not allowing her to process her trauma. Winnie then rushes over to Bernie's house and tries to explain everything to her, but Bernie reveals she still has her memories of their time together in the alternate reality, and they kiss before agreeing to celebrate Christmas together.

287,The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,"In dystopian, war-ravaged Panem, Snow family patriarch General Crassus dies in action during the First Rebellion between the Capitol and thirteen Districts. Years later, Crassus' son, Coriolanus, is one of twenty-four Academy students selected to mentor a 10th Annual Hunger Games tribute. Coriolanus wants to win the Plinth Prize scholarship to restore the Snow name. Games creator and Academy dean Casca Highbottom, who mistreats Coriolanus, advises mentors to focus on entertaining viewers rather than the tributes winning the Games. Coriolanus' wealthy friend and fellow mentor, Sejanus Plinth, resents the Games' cruelty.
Coriolanus is assigned District 12's female tribute, Lucy Gray Baird. During the reaping ceremony, she engages Capitol viewers by singing and slipping a snake into the dress of the mayor's daughter, Mayfair Lipp. While fellow mentor Arachne Crane taunts her tribute, who then kills her, Coriolanus earns Lucy Gray's trust by riding with her to the Capitol Zoo, bringing her food, and promoting her to Capitol citizens, much to Highbottom's displeasure; he paired Coriolanus with a District 12 tribute to fail.
Coriolanus proposes a sponsorship scheme to Head Gamemaker Dr. Volumnia Gaul: Capitol viewers can donate supplies to favored tributes via their mentors during the Games to increase viewership. Coriolanus' class partner, Clemensia Dovecote, takes credit for his proposal. Gaul places the proposal into a tank of genetically modified snakes that attack unfamiliar scents, and forces Clemensia to retrieve it. The snakes bite Clemensia, confirming Coriolanus' authorship.
During a tour of the Games' arena, rebel bombs explode, killing several mentors and tributes. After Lucy Gray saves Coriolanus from falling debris, he gives her rat poison to use as a weapon and tells her about a bomb hole in the arena floor. Several tributes die in the initial bloodbath. Lucy Gray escapes into a tunnel with fellow District 12 tribute, Jessup. Sejanus sneaks into the arena and mourns his fallen tribute Marcus, a former District 2 classmate. Gaul persuades Coriolanus to retrieve Sejanus. When a tribute attacks them, Coriolanus fatally beats him.
The president's son, Felix Ravinstill, dies from injuries in the rebel bombing. As revenge, Gaul releases her snakes into the arena, killing every tribute but Lucy Gray; earlier, Coriolanus secretly put a handkerchief bearing her scent into the tank. Gaul declares her the victor only after Capitol viewers demand it. After the celebration, Highbottom confronts Coriolanus with the handkerchief and poison, sentencing him to twenty years' Peacekeeper service in District 8. Coriolanus bribes an officer to transfer him to District 12; Sejanus volunteers to join him.
In District 12, a hanging execution inspires Lucy Gray's ""The Hanging Tree"" song. Coriolanus and Sejanus visit the Hob bar where Lucy Gray performs with the Covey, a formerly nomadic band; Coriolanus reunites with her. Meanwhile, Sejanus becomes involved in a rebel plot. Coriolanus confronts Sejanus and records his confession using a jabberjay, sending it to Gaul. Coriolanus later finds Sejanus talking to rebel Spruce, Lucy Gray's ex-boyfriend Billy Taupe, and Billy's girlfriend Mayfair. In the ensuring confrontation, Coriolanus kills Mayfair and Spruce kills Billy. Sejanus and Spruce are subsequently hanged for treason.
Lucy Gray and Coriolanus escape northwards. Coriolanus accidentally reveals he killed three people; Lucy Gray knows only two. Coriolanus finds the weapons incriminating him of Mayfair's murder hidden in a cabin. Lucy Gray runs away after realizing she is the only loose end preventing Coriolanus' return. He pursues her and is bitten by a snake she laid as a trap. Disoriented, he shoots his rifle blindly after jabberjays mimic her voice. Her fate is left unknown.
Coriolanus returns to the Capitol, where Gaul reveals she had him honorably discharged and enrolls him at the university. Sejanus' parents, unaware Coriolanus caused their son's death, make him their heir, funding his education. Coriolanus visits Highbottom, who confesses the Games were never intended to be reality; he came up with the idea while drunk, but Crassus submitted the idea as their partner project. Highbottom believes he is responsible for the bloodshed of the Games, and never forgave Crassus. He blames Coriolanus for ensuring the Games' horrific cruelty will continue for generations. Coriolanus kills Highbottom by slipping poison into his morphling vial. Gaul later trains Coriolanus as a Gamemaker, beginning his rise to power.

288,Trolls Band Together,"An infant Branch and his four older brothers John Dory, Spruce, Clay and Floyd perform as a boyband called BroZone. When their clashing egos prevent them from performing the ""Perfect Family Harmony"", a powerful ability that Trolls can achieve when they are in complete sync, the brothers argue and break up the band. Branch is left alone to be raised by his grandmother Rosiepuff.
In present day, about a month after preventing the Rockpocalypse, Branch and Poppy attend Bridget and Gristle's wedding in Bergen Town. They are interrupted by John Dory, who reveals that Branch's closest brother Floyd has been captured by Velvet and Veneer, two Mount Rageon teenagers who wish to be pop stars. The siblings have imprisoned Floyd in a diamond perfume bottle, which they use to extract his essence and improve their singing, although the process could eventually kill him. As the Perfect Family Harmony is the only thing that can destroy diamond, Branch reluctantly agrees to help John Dory find their brothers and rescue Floyd. Along with Poppy and Tiny Diamond, they set out in John Dory's armadillo-like portable van named Rhonda.
They find Spruce at the Vacay Island resort, where he has changed his name to Bruce and started a family. Bruce is reluctant to help, until his wife and 13 kids convince him to do so. The group later finds Clay at an abandoned Bergen miniature golf course, inhabited by a hidden colony of Pop Trolls who do not know that the Bergens are no longer their enemies, having been separated from the other Pop Trolls when they fled the final Trollstice.[a] The hidden troll colony's leader, Viva, reveals herself to be Poppy's long-lost sister. At first, Poppy is delighted, but the visit turns sour when Viva refuses to believe the Bergens have changed, and tries to stop Poppy's group from leaving the golf course. They manage to escape thanks to Clay, and Poppy and Viva separate with broken hearts.
Meanwhile, Velvet and Veneer continue to strip Floyd of his essence. Velvet reveals that she forged Floyd's handwriting and sent a note to John Dory, in order to bait Floyd's brothers to come and rescue him. Furthermore, Velvet and Veneer's assistant Crimp invents shoulder-pad suits that enhance the extraction, which the siblings plan to use when they capture all of BroZone.
The Trolls make it to Mount Rageous, but once again argue and fail to reach Perfect Family Harmony. When his brothers decide they will split up again after saving Floyd, Branch scolds them for abandoning their family and still treating him like a baby, reminding them that he lived his whole life alone after their grandmother got eaten. Branch, Poppy and Tiny locate Floyd on their own, but Velvet and Veneer capture John Dory, Clay, and Bruce, making a rescue even more difficult. Branch and Poppy confront Velvet and Veneer when they start mingling with a crowd of fans, prompting them to drive away in their limo. During the ensuing chase, Velvet and Veneer begin using the shoulder-pads to extract the essence from Branch’s brothers in order to put on a show. Branch and Poppy are soon helped by Viva, who joined forces with Bridget and Gristle after they stumbled onto the golf course during their honeymoon.
Seeing that Floyd is just about out of essence, Branch tells his brothers that they all simply need to put aside their egos and work as a team. They, along with Poppy and Viva, perform the Perfect Family Harmony and break free of their prisons just as Floyd loses the last of his essence, but he is quickly revived. Veneer, who had been second-guessing Velvet's machinations, publicly confesses everything, simultaneously enraging his sister and sending themselves to prison.
The Trolls return to Vacay Island and witness BroZone's comeback concert, joined by Kismet, another band Branch was once part of. Later, Poppy and Viva join BroZone, under Branch's proposal, as honorary members.

289,Thanksgiving (2023 film),"During Thanksgiving in Plymouth, Massachusetts, people are gathering outside the local RightMart superstore in preparation for a Black Friday sale. Jessica Wright, whose father Thomas owns the store, lets her boyfriend Bobby and her friends Evan, Gaby, Scuba, and Yulia inside the store early through a side door. The crowd outside sees them and, in a frenzy, stampedes into the store, resulting in multiple people dying, including Amanda Collins, the wife of store manager Mitch. Bobby gets his arm broken when he tries to rescue someone and subsequently disappears from the group.
One year later, RightMart is preparing for another Black Friday sale, despite the protests of Mitch and several other residents. Meanwhile, Jessica and her friends are tagged in a social media post of a Thanksgiving table with their names around it. Bobby, who has broken up with Jessica, returns to Plymouth to work for his uncle after being injured in the riot, much to the chagrin of Jessica's current boyfriend Ryan. A waitress named Lizzie is attacked and killed by a figure dressed in black clothing wearing a John Carver mask. The police discover that Lizzie was present at the Black Friday incident, which leads them to believe those involved in the massacre are being targeted by Carver.
Jessica aids the investigation by providing footage of the riot to the town's sheriff, Eric Newlon. Carver rampages through Plymouth and kills several residents, including RightMart security guard Manny and high school students Amy and Lonnie. Evan and Gaby are soon abducted by Carver, while Jessica narrowly avoids being killed. Yulia's father decides to move their family to Florida, but he and the deputy sheriff guarding them are killed by Carver, who attacks Yulia. Jessica and Scuba drive to Yulia's house, but are unable to stop Carver from disemboweling Yulia with a buzzsaw before he escapes.
The police attempt to lure Carver out by having the Wright family and Scuba participate in a Thanksgiving parade, disguised as Pilgrims. However, Carver deduces their plan and decapitates a turkey mascot before sending smoke bombs into the crowd, causing everyone to scatter in panic and giving Carver the opportunity to abduct the Wrights and Scuba in the chaos. Carver then cooks Jessica's stepmother Kathleen alive in an oven before serving her as the ""turkey"" at a dinner table surrounded by his hostages and his victims' corpses. Carver then bludgeons Evan to death in a livestream before Jessica cuts through her bindings and escapes, luring him away from the others. She eludes Carver by climbing over a fence and running through the woods. Jessica makes it to a parade warehouse, and finds Newlon unconscious. When she follows a figure wearing Carver's mask inside, she sees it is Bobby. She calls Newlon to help capture Bobby, but he escapes.
The police soon arrive and inform them that the survivors are safe. Once they leave Jessica and Newlon alone, Jessica notices the same bramble debris from the fence and the deep woods that stuck to her are also on Newlon's clothing and sneakers, realizing he is the killer. Newlon reveals that he was having an affair with Amanda, who was pregnant with his child before she died. This was his motive to become Carver and seek revenge on those responsible. To Newlon's horror, it is revealed that Jessica has livestreamed his confession, leading him to attack her until she is saved by Bobby.
As they attempt to escape in a tow truck belonging to Bobby's uncle, Newlon hooks it to a support beam and approaches them with an axe.

291,Saltburn (film),"In late 2006,[9] scholarship student Oliver Quick from Prescot struggles to fit in at the University of Oxford because of his inexperience with upper-class manners. He befriends Felix Catton, an affluent and popular student who is sympathetic to Oliver's stories of his parents' substance abuse and mental health issues. When Oliver becomes distraught over his father's sudden death, Felix comforts him and invites him to spend the summer at his family's country house, Saltburn.
At Saltburn, Oliver meets Felix's eccentric parents Sir James and Lady Elspeth, his sister Venetia, and Elspeth's friend Pamela, as well as Felix's American cousin Farleigh, with whom Oliver has had a tense relationship as classmates at the university.
Oliver quickly wins over Felix's family (except for Farleigh), and his obsession with Felix grows. One night, he watches Felix masturbating in a bathtub and lustfully drinks the semen-laced bathwater. Oliver waves to Venetia and performs oral sex on her while she is on her period. Farleigh witnesses this and informs Felix. When Felix confronts Oliver about the accusation, he claims nothing happened. At night, Oliver initiates sexual advances on Farleigh, threatening him in the process. The next morning, James evicts Farleigh after receiving a report from Sotheby's about Farleigh's intention to sell some of James's valuables.
As the summer ends, Elspeth and James plan a party for Oliver's birthday. Felix surprises Oliver with a trip to see his estranged mother, causing Oliver to panic. Upon arriving at the family's house in Prescot, Felix realises that Oliver lied to him about his upbringing. Oliver's father is still alive; neither of his parents are substance abusers; and they live in a respectable middle-class suburb. Horrified and hurt by Oliver's deception, Felix decides not to tell anyone to spare his own family the humiliation, but he orders Oliver to leave Saltburn after the party. During the celebrations, Oliver seeks to make amends with Felix by expressing his adoration for him. Felix rejects him and suggests he seek help.
The next morning, Felix is found dead in Saltburn's hedge maze. Oliver implies Felix's death was connected to Farleigh supplying drugs during the party, and James withdraws financial support from Farleigh and bans him from returning. Oliver mourns Felix and visits his grave alone, where he places flowers, lies naked on the grave soil, and masturbates on it.
After Felix's funeral, Elspeth insists that Oliver extend his stay at Saltburn. Venetia, increasingly distraught and disturbed, accuses Oliver of destroying her family, calling him a moth, a serf and a spider. He attempts to placate her, but she eventually rebuffs him, disturbed by his growing impersonation of Felix. The next day, Venetia is found dead, having killed herself in the bathtub. Despondent over Oliver's continuing presence at Saltburn and Elspeth's closeness to him, James bribes him to leave, which Oliver accepts.
In 2022, Oliver reads about James's death in a newspaper. He subsequently has what appears to be a chance encounter with Elspeth at a café. She is delighted to see him again, insisting he return with her to Saltburn. After spending several months with Oliver, Elspeth becomes terminally ill. At her deathbed, Oliver confides in Elspeth that he is responsible for the tragic events at Saltburn. He had orchestrated his meeting Felix at Oxford and even planned his encounter with Elspeth at the café, after which she bequeathed all her assets, including Saltburn, to him. Oliver comforts Elspeth and then murders her by removing her life support. Having now assumed ownership of Saltburn and the Catton family fortune, he dances happily naked around the mansion.

292,May December,"In 2015, actress Elizabeth Berry arrives in Savannah, Georgia, to research her upcoming role in an independent film. Elizabeth will be playing Gracie Atherton-Yoo, who, in 1992 at the age of 36, was caught having sex with 13-year-old Korean-American Joe Yoo, a schoolmate of her son Georgie, at the pet store where they both worked. During a prison sentence, Gracie gave birth to Joe's child. 23 years later, Gracie and Joe are married with three children: Honor, who is at college, and twins Charlie and Mary, who are about to graduate from high school.
Elizabeth interviews Gracie and Joe about their relationship. Visiting the pet store where the couple met and worked, Elizabeth sees the stock room where Gracie and Joe were caught having sex and reenacts the scene alone. She speaks with Tom, Gracie's first husband, Georgie, who is now a musician, and her defense lawyer. They portray Gracie in varying ways, depicting her as naïve and passive, but also show how destructive her actions were.
Joe engages in a private text conversation with an unnamed friend who shares his hobby of rearing monarch butterflies. At one point, he proposes they take a vacation together, but she rebuffs him by reminding him that he is married.
Elizabeth participates in a Q&A at the twins' high school and discusses the intimacy actors and crew members feel when shooting a sex scene. When Elizabeth says she enjoys playing morally-ambiguous characters, Mary is visibly offended.
At home, Charlie shares a cannabis joint with Joe, who reveals to his son that he has never tried cannabis before. High, Joe has a breakdown and weeps in Charlie's arms.
The family, accompanied by Elizabeth, celebrate the twins' graduation. At the restaurant, they have an awkward encounter with Tom, Georgie, and Gracie's old family. Georgie proposes that Elizabeth get him a job as a music supervisor on the film in exchange for details about Gracie's life; he claims that he read Gracie's diary and discovered that her older brothers had sexually abused her. Georgie also threatens that if not given the job, he will disparage the film to the press when it is released. Elizabeth gets a ride home from Joe.
Elizabeth invites Joe to her accommodation, where he gives her a letter Gracie wrote him early in their relationship. The two have sex, and Elizabeth tells Joe that he still has time to start a new life. Joe leaves once she refers to his experiences as a ""story"", saying that story is ""his life"". Joe tearfully confronts Gracie about the start of their relationship, wondering whether he was ""too young"". Gracie insists he seduced her, and repeatedly asks who was really in control.
The morning of graduation, one of Joe's butterflies emerges from its chrysalis. Later, the whole family watches Charlie and Mary graduate while Joe weeps alone in the crowd. As Elizabeth prepares to leave, Gracie tells her that Georgie fabricated the story of abuse by her brothers.
On the set of the film, Elizabeth films multiple takes of a scene depicting Gracie grooming Joe at the pet store. While the director is satisfied, she asks to film another take, insisting that the scene is ""getting more real"".

293,Dashing Through the Snow,"Eddie Garrick is a social worker who is cynical about the holidays due to an incident in his youth when a mall store Santa, whom he asked in confidence to help keep his parents together, tried to rob his house. As an adult, he is separated from his wife Allison and they have a daughter named Charlotte. While Allison does some last-minute shopping, Eddie spends time with Charlotte and heads over to his neighbor's house to feed their cat. He encounters a man dressed as Santa named Nicholas Sinter-Claus, or Nick for short, who claims to be the real Santa. Nick appears to be highly dismissive of everything and is cautious of three people who are following him.
Eddie decides to take Nick to the hospital, believing him to be mentally unhealthy, and Charlotte tags along. Nick proceeds to reveal details about himself and Charlotte that convinces her that he is the real Santa. The three grunts proceed to chase after Eddie, Nick, and Charlotte who escape, but their car breaks down. They hail a taxi, but when they are being followed again, Nick rolls out of the car and hides in a club where everyone is dressed as Santa. Nick and Charlotte follow him and lose the trailers after getting rescued by a family named the Truckles. The Truckles are obsessed with Santa and using their equipment were able to track down Nick who once again makes a hasty exit, forcing Eddie and Charlotte to follow him again.
Nick takes Eddie and Charlotte to one of his warehouses which is loaded with many of his on-ground supporters including a couple named Gerald and Lucille, who fix his equipment. Nick reveals why he has been running: one of his stops was the house of Conrad Harf, a trusted congressman who was hiding one of his crooked schemes. The three people chasing them all night worked for him and Nick accidentally got his tablet mixed up with Conrad's, which contained a list of locations that they were hoping to pave over. Misinterpreting the situation, Eddie believes that Nick is another burglar and calls the police to come and arrest him, against Charlotte's wishes.
At the police station, Nick is taken away, but deduces that the ""detectives"" taking him are more of Conrad's goons. Eddie realizes that Nick left the tablet with him and manages to unlock it, learning that he was telling the truth.
Eddie and Charlotte recruit the Truckles to help locate Nick who has been taken straight to Conrad who is attending the Mayor's Christmas party. Eddie arrives to free Nick, but they are caught. Now fully believing Nick, Eddie activates his reindeer caller, causing all of Nick's reindeer to appear and beat up the bad guys. Conrad and his associates are arrested, though Nick gives Conrad an Action Arthur figure that he originally wanted as a young boy in good faith. Nick then gets his reindeer and flies away.
Eddie and Charlotte return home to Allison who is in disbelief over their claim that they were hanging out with Santa until Nick arrives to give them one last gift, a dog named Bulldozer, which he had earlier told Eddie he would be giving him. Eddie renews his romance with Allison as he invites the Truckles to spend the holidays with them, while Nick flies off to finish his Christmas deliveries.

294,Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain,"Ben, John, and Martin are childhood friends who live and work together at Trout Plus, an outdoor store owned by Ben's father Farley. John, who is becoming anxious at his friends' new interests—Ben in taking over Trout Plus from his father, Martin in his new religious girlfriend Amy—discovers through a TikTok video that a compass the three found as children may be a clue to a treasure hidden by explorer Jean Pierre La Roche. The treasure, a bust of Marie Antoinette, is worth $100 million.
The three set off for Foggy Mountain State Park, where they encounter park rangers Lisa and Taylor. Lisa and John take an instant interest in each other, and John reveals the goal of their trip. After meeting up with the trio in the park and Lisa sharing an intimate night with John, the two steal the boys' map and attempt to search for the treasure themselves. The boys discover that the compass points the way to the treasure, and after Ben unsuccessfully tries to fly to the location with a wingsuit, they are led to a hidden chamber inside a rock formation. The three fend off a wild animal and retrieve the bust.
After escaping from Lisa and Taylor, the boys come across a cult made up of treasure hunters who failed to find the bust. John attempts to hide the treasure, but it is found by the cultists, who prepare to ritually burn it as a rejection of their former greed. The cult's leader, Deetch Nordwind, has second thoughts, but before he can retrieve the bust John uses stage magic to disappear with the treasure; however, he decides to turn it over to Ben and Martin and return to the cult.
Two weeks later, Ben and Martin meet on the day the bust is to be sold. They are interrupted by John, who begs the two to rescue him from the cult. After initial reluctance, the two rush to save John and Lisa, who have also joined the cult. John accidentally reveals to the cult that the bust will be sold, and they rush to Trout Plus to steal the bust for themselves, leaving John behind. Ben and Martin rescue John and successfully use their wingsuits to fly back to the store, where the bust is being delivered to Gaten Matarazzo, only for him to be murdered by the cult. A battle ensues, with Nordwind retrieving the bust, only for a hawk the trio befriended to snatch it away. After Nordwind rushes to chase the hawk, it returns the bust to the boys. With the money from the bust, each of the boys achieve their dreams: John takes a trip to London with his friends, Ben starts his own business—a hair salon for boys—and Martin and Amy purchase a house together.

296,Wish (film),"King Magnifico and his wife Queen Amaya establish the kingdom of Rosas on an island in the Mediterranean Sea. Having studied sorcery, Magnifico is able to grant the greatest desires of his subjects; each of them give up the memory of their wishes to be sealed and protected by the king until he can grant them. Once a month, as a ceremonial event, Magnifico chooses one wish to be granted.
17-year-old Asha prepares to interview for the job of Magnifico's apprentice on the day of her grandfather Sabino's 100th birthday, hoping that Magnifico will grant Sabino's wish to inspire people. The interview goes well until Asha requests for Sabino's wish to be granted, which Magnifico declines, seeing the wish's elusiveness as a potential threat to his power. Asha realizes Magnifico never intends to return the ungranted wishes to their owners, and when she questions his methods, Magnifico refuses to accept her apprenticeship or grant any of her family members' wishes.
Asha tries but fails to convince Sabino and her mother Sakina that Magnifico is deceiving them. Distraught, she makes her own wish on a star. To her surprise, the star descends from the sky in the form of an anthropomorphic ball of light, which Asha names Star. Star's magic gives the forest animals, including Asha's pet goat Valentino, the ability to talk, prompting Asha to enlist Star's help in retrieving her family's wishes. Everyone in the kingdom senses Star's presence, and Magnifico feels threatened by it. Despite Amaya's pleas, he turns to forbidden dark magic to maintain his position of power as his subjects begin to doubt his way of ruling.
Asha retrieves Sabino's wish and he is overjoyed to be able to remember it, but Magnifico arrives to arrest them, having been informed that Asha was responsible for Star's summoning. Corrupted by the dark magic, Magnifico intends to use Star's magic and Rosas' wishes to increase his own power, forcing Sabino and Sakina to flee to a nearby island while Asha, Star, and Valentino stay behind to free the citizens' wishes. One of Asha's friends, Simon, is revealed to be the one who sold Asha out to Magnifico in hopes that his wish to become a knight would be granted. Magnifico grants the wish, but additionally bewitches Simon into being his henchman in capturing Asha.
Asha rallies her other friends Dahlia, Bazeema, Dario, Gabo, Hal, and Safi. Amaya also joins them, having discovered Magnifico's corruption. While her friends infiltrate Magnifico's study and open up the ceiling to free the wishes, Asha tries to distract Magnifico, only to be tricked by a disguised Simon, whom she defeats with the animals' help. Magnifico ascends the castle's tower, absorbing the power of every wish and trapping Star. Asha attempts to stop him but is easily overpowered as Magnifico blocks out the sky and immobilizes the citizens, preventing them from wishing on stars.
Unwilling to give up, Asha encourages the citizens to make a wish about changing Rosas' future. The strength of their collective desire eventually overpowers Magnifico, whose magic turns against him by trapping him inside his staff's mirror, while the citizens regain their sealed wishes with a newfound appreciation of pursuing them.
Amaya becomes the sole ruler of Rosas, helping the citizens make their wishes come true on their own. A regretful Simon is forgiven by Asha and her friends. Star gifts Asha with a magic wand so that she can inspire people to keep dreaming before returning to the sky among the other stars.

297,Napoleon (2023 film),"In 1793, amid the French Revolution, young army officer Napoleon Bonaparte watches Marie Antoinette beheaded by the guillotine. Later that year, Revolutionary leader Paul Barras has Napoleon manage the Siege of Toulon; he successfully storms the city and repels the British ships with artillery. After Maximilien Robespierre is deposed and executed at the end of the Reign of Terror, French leaders, including Napoleon, attempt to restore stability. Again employing artillery, Napoleon suppresses the royalist insurrection on 13 Vendémiaire in 1795.
Napoleon woos aristocratic widow Joséphine de Beauharnais and the two eventually marry. Despite their vigorous sex life, they bear no children. In Egypt, he prevails again at the Battle of the Pyramids in 1798, but rushes home when he hears Joséphine has an almost 10-year younger lover, Hippolyte Charles. The Directory criticises him for abandoning his troops, but he condemns them for their poor leadership of France and, alongside several collaborators such as Talleyrand, Fouché, Sieyès and Ducos, overthrows them in a coup and becomes First Consul.
Napoleon is crowned Emperor of the French by the pope in 1804, during which he audaciously puts the crown on his own head. Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggests to Austria an alliance, though the Austrians dismiss the idea. A year later, Napoleon outmanoeuvres and defeats the Austrians and Russians at the Battle of Austerlitz, forcing them to retreat over frozen lakes before bombarding the ice and drowning them. Afterwards, he invites Austrian Emperor Francis II for wine—which Russian Tsar Alexander I declines to attend—and tells Francis that since he did not totally destroy their armies, he expects the latter to be grateful.
Napoleon's mother has him impregnate a mistress, proving that Joséphine is infertile. He divorces her in 1810, publicly slapping her in the face when she initially refuses to read her portion of the decree, but the two remain on good terms and continue exchanging friendly letters. Napoleon marries Marie Louise of Austria, who bears a son one year later.
In 1812, Napoleon invades Russia after Alexander reneges on a peace treaty with France. He prevails, despite bloody guerrilla resistance by Don Cossack forces, at the Battle of Borodino, but finds Moscow empty and later set aflame. Napoleon retreats during the winter to France, having lost about half a million men. In 1814, the Coalition force Napoleon's abdication and exile him to Elba.
In 1815, upon hearing that Joséphine is unwell, Napoleon escapes the island and returns to power in France. She, having been forced into reclusion at the Château de Malmaison, dies before he arrives. King Louis XVIII sends the Fifth Regiment to stop Napoleon, but he charms them into joining him.
At the Battle of Waterloo in June, Napoleon, having amassed more troops, confronts the British army under the Duke of Wellington. French cavalry charges are repulsed by British infantry squares, and a desperate Napoleon urges his remaining soldiers forward, but this advance is decimated by re-formed lines of enemy infantry. The forces of Prussian Marshal Blücher arrive to reinforce Wellington, and the French are broken. As Napoleon retreats, he salutes Wellington.
Napoleon is exiled, this time to the island of Saint Helena in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and is seen bantering with children, writing his memoirs that would become a worldwide best-seller, and presenting to his listeners a version of history where he is always right.
Napoleon dies in 1821, hearing Joséphine beckon him to meet her again. An epilogue notes that roughly 3 million people died in the Coalition Wars (1792–1815).

298,Maestro (2023 film),"Leonard Bernstein, at the age of nearly 70, plays a sequence on a piano from his opera A Quiet Place while being interviewed in his home.[7] After he finishes, he shares brief details regarding the significant impact left on him by Felicia, his wife of many years, and mentions seeing her ghost.
In 1943, Leonard—then the 25-year-old assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic—makes his conducting debut at short notice when guest conductor Bruno Walter falls ill. His exceptional performance enjoys a rapturous reception from the audience and catapults him to fame. Despite being in an intermittent relationship with clarinetist David Oppenheim, he falls for aspiring actress Felicia Montealegre at a party and the two begin dating. He breaks up with David, who is heartbroken but reluctantly accepts Leonard's choice. Leonard and Felicia ultimately marry and have three children: Jamie, Alexander, and Nina. Throughout their marriage, they are seen supporting each other in their careers.
By the mid-1950s, the Bernsteins live a highly affluent life in the public eye, with Leonard having composed several successful operas and Broadway musicals, including Candide and West Side Story. Felicia combats concerns raised about Leonard's affairs with men, insistent that she holds rein over him as his wife. As the years pass, however, Leonard's dalliances—as well as his alcohol and substance abuse—take a deep toll on their marriage. These issues are compounded when Jamie hears whispers of her father's infidelity. Leonard attempts to deny the rumors as fueled by ""jealousies"".
One Thanksgiving, after Leonard returns home to their apartment in The Dakota late from a bender, he and Felicia have an explosive argument where she insists that he has hate in his heart, and will ""die a lonely old queen"" if he continues on his current path. Despite the breakdown of their relationship, the couple remains married through Leonard's composition of Mass in 1971. In 1973, Leonard conducts Mahler's Resurrection Symphony in a legendary performance at Ely Cathedral, England. Amidst the uproarious reception, Felicia reconciles with Leonard, insistent that ""there's no hate in [his] heart.""
Felicia is diagnosed with breast cancer which has metastasized to the lung; despite surgeries and an aggressive chemotherapy regimen, her condition deteriorates, and she dies in Leonard's arms in 1978. Overcome with grief, Leonard and the children abandon their lavish home shortly afterward. Leonard is shown once again in 1987, teaching the art of conducting and still partying, as well as having affairs with his much younger male students. Returning to the interview, Leonard admits that he misses Felicia terribly, before his mind flashes back to an image of her, back in their youth, walking into their yard.

299,Leave the World Behind (film),"Misanthrope Amanda Sandford[3] arranges an impromptu weekend getaway at a vacation rental to spend quality time together with her husband Clay and their kids, Archie and Rose. While shopping for groceries, Amanda sees a man stocking up on large quantities of canned food and water. Later, while the family relaxes at a nearby beach, they evade an oil tanker that runs ashore. When they return to the house, they notice the TV and Wi-Fi are not working and a pair of deer stare at them.
That night, the owner, George H. (""G.H."") Scott, and his daughter, Ruth, arrive at the house. Seeking shelter, G.H. explains that a blackout caused their return. Amanda is suspicious and doesn't want them to stay. Clay however trusts them and lets them stay the night.
The next morning, Rose is frustrated that the Wi-Fi and TV are still down, which has prevented her from watching the series finale of Friends. Amanda notices four news alerts on her phone about the blackout, the third of which is about hackers, and the final one shows a corrupted message. Rose sees a larger herd of deer motionless in the backyard.
Attempting to learn about the disruptions and fix the Wi-Fi, Clay drives to town while G.H. heads to his neighbor's house. Clay abandons a Spanish-speaking woman seeking help and drives from a drone dropping leaflets written in Arabic, while G.H. searches the neighbor's home, discovers the wreckage of a plane crash on the nearby beach, and narrowly avoids a second one.
Elsewhere, Rose walks along with Archie in the nearby woods, where they come across an empty shed, and Archie removes a tick from his ankle on the way back. Returning to the house, G.H. confides to Amanda the events he witnessed. He theorizes that nationwide satellite connectivity has been disrupted, but he is cut off by a loud, shrill noise. Amanda recalls the man stockpiling supplies, whom G.H. assumes is Danny, his contractor. Clay returns shaken with the leaflet, which Archie partially translates as ""Death to America"". Fed up, the Sandfords flee the rental, intending to drive to Amanda's sister in New Jersey, but find the highway jammed with collided self-driving Teslas; they narrowly avoid more incoming cars, and they are forced to return to G.H.'s house.
Throughout the night, Ruth asks Clay provocative questions and they later discover flamingoes in the pool. Amanda and G.H. establish a friendly bond but they are cut off by a second shrill noise, and the power fails. Later, Rose tells Amanda a story from an episode of The West Wing where God attempts to save a man from a flood with several warnings and escape opportunities.
The next morning, Archie's teeth inexplicably fall out. Believing it is related to the tick bite, G.H. suggests visiting Danny for medicine. Rose is now missing, and G.H. and Clay take Archie to visit Danny, while Amanda and Ruth search for Rose. At the shed, the two are confronted by an even larger herd of deer, which they scare away. Meanwhile, G.H. and Clay attempt to convince Danny to help Archie, which results in an armed standoff between G.H. and Danny. Clay intervenes, convincing Danny to help Archie. Afterward, Danny tells G.H. that another neighbor may be equipped with an underground bunker and suggests that the noise and Archie's teeth falling out are the results of a microwave weapon.
Shaken, G.H. hypothesizes to Clay and Archie that the country is in a three-stage campaign that will result in a coup d'état. At the same time, Amanda and Ruth watch New York City being bombed. Rose then finds the neighbor's house with the bunker. Inside, a computer message warns of elevated radiation levels across multiple U.S. cities. She finds a DVD of Friends, and watches the series finale.

300,Good Burger 2,"26 years after the events of the first film, Dexter Reed has quit Good Burger in the hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur, but his invention ideas turn out to be failures. His latest invention, a spray that can make any material flame-retardant, backfires as he attempts to showcase the material on his own house in a demonstration for investors, including Mark Cuban, that ends up burning it down. Left without a home and business, Dexter looks to move in with his sister Charlotte, but she refuses as she is one of his investors. He then calls Ed, who still works at Good Burger and agrees to let him stay at his home.
Dexter visits Good Burger to find numerous new employees: two twins Cindy and Mindy; the elderly Ruth; Ed's son Ed 2, who looks and acts exactly like Ed; and Dexter's niece Mia, Charlotte's daughter who wants nothing to do with Dexter. The restaurant has a new manager named Mr. Jensen. In addition to working as the cashier, Ed is now the owner due to his love of the restaurant. The only familiar employee is Fizz, whom Ed had accidentally left in the freezer for 22 years and is thawed out. At Ed's home, Dexter meets Ed's family: his wife Edie and their numerous other children who look like Ed and are named after condiments. Dexter is shocked to find that Roxanne, who previously tried to seduce Ed for the recipe for his sauce for Mondo Burger, now works as their nanny.
Dexter decides to work at Good Burger again while considering his next entrepreneurial venture. When he pitches his permanent ice idea to Mia, she laughs it off. Meanwhile, Ed has been hounded by Cecil McNevin, a lawyer for the conglomerate MegaCorp, to turn Good Burger into a global franchise, but Ed is uncertain. MegaCorp sends a pair of goons to force Ed into signing the agreement, but Ed's natural clumsiness gets them hurt. Cecil tries to appeal to Dexter, explaining their intent is to expand Good Burger but not to take it away from Ed and are planning to give the employees big raises. Dexter considers it based on the financial benefit and then brings Ed to lunch with Cecil to explain the deal and they both agree to sign.
At the franchise launch party, Cecil reveals that the flagship store is being shut down with their employees being fired as mandated by the contract, which Dexter and Ed had failed to read before signing. With everyone turning against Dexter, he takes Ed to MegaCorp headquarters to demand they reinstate the flagship restaurant and rehire the employees. They meet with the CEO Katt Bozwell, the sister of former Mondo Burger owner Kurt Bozwell who wants revenge on Good Burger after sending Kurt away to prison. She is planning to rebrand the restaurant Mega Good Burger and has plans to replace all employees with robot versions of Ed. After destroying the Good Burger car, MegaCorp sends them home in a self-driving delivery car which Katt sends out of control to get rid of them. Dexter forces the car to drive in a circle until it runs out of power.
Lamenting his failures, Dexter gets Ed to rally the Good Burger employees to stop the launch of Mega Good Burger. They plan to infiltrate MegaCorp headquarters so Mia, a computer expert, can shut down the machines before the launch. While Dexter, Ed, and Mia infiltrate the building, the other employees create a distraction, but their ruse is uncovered. Dexter and Ed get separated from Mia and find the control room while Mia is trapped on a conveyor belt. Dexter goes off to find Mia, leaving Ed to shut down the restaurants. Dexter saves Mia, but they are captured and taken to the control room where Ed is also taken. As Katt gives the first demonstration on national television, the robotic Ed throws food at her, followed by the other machines shooting food at everyone at every location around the world. Ed had decided reprogramming the machines to go haywire would be better.
In the aftermath, MegaCorp is shut down and Ed is given back ownership of the original Good Burger. Charlotte comes to visit Dexter and Mia and Dexter is allowed to apologize to her. Ed and Ed 2 reveal to Dexter that they figured out how to make permanent ice and Good Burger successfully sells it to Mark Cuban, making $10 million.

301,Genie (2023 film),"Bernard is overworked and overstressed at his job with a high-end auction house in New York. In trying to satisfy the unreasonable demands of his narcissistic, greedy, cruel boss, Mr. Flaxman, Bernard misses his daughter Eve's 8th birthday (and other family time). Having failed to bring his daughter a birthday present, Bernard lamely offers her an antique box that he had sitting in their home. Bernard's disappointed wife Julie leaves him, and the next day Mr. Flaxman fires Bernard. A dejected Bernard wipes dust off the box, and swirling colorfully out of it appears a 2,000+ year-old genie named Flora, an eccentric middle-aged woman, who tells Bernard that she can grant him unlimited wishes.
Flora encourages Bernard to solve his problems by making a plan and using his wishes to execute it. Bernard is slow to come up with a good plan, and his early wishes tend to go awry.  For example, when his family comes to visit, he accidentally sends one of them briefly to a fiery hell before sending them all back home. Another involves redecorating the apartment in a way that his wife might like, including swapping the Mona Lisa for a framed football jersey, which she never liked to see hanging on the wall. This ends up with Bernard and Flora being arrested and threatened with extradition to France. Nevertheless, Bernard is able to reconnect with his daughter and makes some wishes that help fulfill the Christmas dreams of children and house the homeless. Flora comes to respect Bernard's character. She also develops a romantic interest in Bernard's doorman, Lenny.
Bernard has seen that Flora is rather sad and lonely as a genie, and he uses a wish to free her. She tells him that he will still have three wishes afterwards. He uses the first wish to go back in time to the point before he had missed his daughter's birthday. He quits his job at the auction house, instead taking his wife and daughter out for her birthday, and giving her a doll house, which she had hoped for. He uses his last two wishes to make sure that they have a wonderful dinner at an exclusive restaurant. Three months later, Bernard goes out to pick up a pizza: Lenny now is running Bernard's favorite pizza joint, and Flora is making the pies.

302,Family Switch,"In Los Angeles, the Walker family, comprising the working couple Jess and Bill, along with their three children CC, Wyatt and Miles, are a divided family: the parents and the children routinely find themselves at odds, primarily due to their respective outlooks towards life. With Christmas approaching, the convivial parents vainly attempt to draw the emotionally-distant children to spend more time together than individually. During an excursion to the Griffith Observatory to witness a rare planetary alignment, the fissures between the family erupt - with Jess and CC, Bill and Wyatt simultaneously wishing each other to try being them for a more intimate understanding. While asking an astrologer, Angelica, to take a family picture, a blinding flash rocks the observatory; in the melee, the family accidentally damage the telescope.
The next morning, the family awaken to find themselves spiritually split from each other: Jess and CC find themselves in other's bodies, as do Bill and Wyatt, much to their collective horror. Moving to resolve the quagmire, the family employ their unknowing neighbor Rolf to babysit toddler Miles and family dog Pickles, who were also switched. At the observatory, the family manage to bribe the staff to accelerate the telescope's repairs with the aim of reverting into their original bodies by the end of the planetary alignment.
Attempts by the family to pursue their regular lives in each other's bodies culminates in disaster: ""Jess"" (CC), attempts to deliver a presentation to an important client on her mother's behalf, which is ruined when she hastily devours ice cream, kicking in her mother's lactose intolerance, causing her to fart profusely during the meeting, while ""CC"" (Jess), intentionally compromises her daughter's crucial soccer match to help an injured opponent, which is witnessed by a national recruiter in attendance; ""Wyatt"" (Bill) bungles his son's interview for a Yale scholarship with his nonchalant attitude, and ""Bill"" (Wyatt), despite his strange demeanor that day, is invited to a party hosted by his son's crush, Ariana.
Exasperated, the family proceed to discover that the telescope is missing a specially-made lens that is crucial to its functioning. Realizing that next alignment would not be until 2162, ""Bill"" calls in a favor to procure the lens early. Privately, ""Bill"" divulges the party invitation to ""Wyatt"", who reluctantly attends with ""CC""; he ends up fumbling a would-be intimate moment with Ariana, but he also stands up to his son's bully. Meanwhile, ""Jess"" and ""Bill"", who are pressured into kissing by their unknowing neighbors, sneak into the party, where the four manage to enjoy a moment of togetherness, which is sunk when ""Bill"" learns of ""Wyatt""'s rejection of Ariana.
The next day, however, the family learn the hardships each other has to face; ""Jess"" discovers her mother's sacrifices at work for her daughter's soccer talent, while ""CC"" discovers her daughter's academic sincerity outside of soccer; ""Bill"" discovers that his father had sacrificed a potential music career to be a parent. Accepting that their individual life pursuits may have been lost owing to the ""switching"", the family resolve to stay together irrespectively. They team up to sing at the Bill's music concert, which is attended by Jess's clients. The show is a success, and ""Jess"" is awarded a promotion. ""Bill"" finally receives the crucial telescopic lens, and the family race to the observatory with assistance from Angelica. They make it in time, but ""Bill"" accidentally slips over, destroying the lens in the process. However, they discover ""Miles"" had pocketed the original lens before the switch; they use it, but nothing occurs.
The next morning, the family discovers they have reverted to their original bodies. Wyatt patches up his relationship with Ariana, sharing a first kiss with her, and CC is given a second chance for national soccer tryouts by the recruiter, who admired her sportsmanship at the game. Angelica watches the reunited family, wishing them a Merry Christmas before driving away.

304,Silent Night (2023 film),"Brian Godlock is an electrician living a happy life in the fictional town of Las Palomas, Texas with his wife Saya and young son Taylor Michael. On Christmas Eve in 2021, Brian and Taylor are using a new bicycle on their front lawn. They are caught in the crossfire of a drive-by shooting in the middle of a gang war and Taylor is killed. Brian immediately tries to catch and kill the gangsters only for the leader of one of the gangs, Playa, to shoot him in the throat and leave him for dead. Brian survives, but his vocal cords have been severely damaged. Brian and Saya grieve over Taylor's death and Saya tries to be emotionally supportive to Brian during his physical recovery, but Brian becomes cold and distant, focused only on pursuing revenge for Taylor.
Saya becomes emotionally overwhelmed and leaves Brian, who plans to kill all the gang members involved in Taylor's death on Christmas Eve in 2022. Over the course of the next year, Brian engages in bodybuilding, familiarizing himself with deadly weaponry and self-defense training. At one point, Brian appears to attempt to visit Detective Dennis Vassel, who offered to help in his son's case. Brian instead uses this opportunity to gather information on Playa's gang and begins reconnaissance on them, collecting evidence that will help put them away. Saya attempts to contact Brian, expressing that she and his parents are worried about him, but he continues to ignore her text messages. Brian attacks and abducts a member of Playa's gang, hurting and threatening him in an attempt to give written information on the gang's activity.
The thug briefly manages to escape, only for Brian to subdue him in a fight. Brian delivers the bound thug to Vassel's house, along with a Christmas card, containing his intent to kill Playa and his gang, and a thumb drive with the evidence he has collected, along with the thug's written contributions to his information. He also sends two of the thug's amputated fingers to Playa, intimidating him. Brian spends the entire night of Christmas Eve 2022 killing the members of Playa's gang one by one, often interrupting their crimes in the process. After stealing a cell phone from a thug and using it to record a video of him being killed and sending it to Playa, the gang leader sends a group text for his soldiers to meet him at his place. Brian takes the opportunity to trap and kill them all there.
After a massive gunfight and fistfight bloodbath as he fights his way to Playa, Brian finds himself confronted by Detective Vassel. Initially pointing their guns at one another, both silently put them down and agree to work as a team to finish off Playa. Playa's drug-addicted girlfriend manages to get the drop on them, shooting them both, only for Brian to sneak around and hold her at gunpoint. She drops her gun and feigns surrender. When Brian hesitates to kill her, Playa's girlfriend unveils a hidden sidearm and attacks him with it. Brian manages to kill her and confronts Playa. In the shootout between them, Playa manages to get the upper hand and is about to shoot Brian in the throat again, but Detective Vassel shoots Playa, allowing Brian to finish him off.
Brian and Detective Vassel fall to the floor and look up at the ceiling and Christmas decorations, bleeding out and dying. Brian sees reflections of his memories of his time with Taylor and hallucinates an alternate future, where he and Taylor are both still alive. Saya opens a letter that Brian wrote to her, where he apologizes for how cold he has become in their marriage and thanks her for loving him. Brian further tells that he knows no one can make Taylor's death right, but that he is going to die trying. Saya takes the letter to Taylor's grave, where Brian had earlier brought his previously unopened Christmas present (a toy train set) that he built and set up around his grave.

305,Candy Cane Lane (film),"Corporate marketer Chris Carver makes his own hand-carved decorations for the local neighborhood Christmas decoration competition but has never won, thus being envious of his neighbor Bruce who repeatedly wins with inflatables and other inexpensive mass market decorations. Shortly before Christmas, he is laid off, leading to him desperately competing for the $100,000 grand prize given to the winner by Prism Cable.
Seeking supplies, Chris and his youngest daughter Holly stumble across a mysterious Christmas shop called ""Kringle's"", filled with beautiful decorations and figurines. He buys a large tree-shaped zoetrope based on ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"". When presented with the receipt, Chris is urged to sign it by shopkeeper Pepper without reading the fine print. Using the new decoration, the family impresses at the competition.
The next day, the images from the tree are gone and there are seven swans swimming in the family's pool. Chris blames Bruce for the act and returns to Kringle's with Holly, seeking replacements. Meanwhile, Chris's wife Carol is attacked at work by six geese laying and three French hens (wearing Frenchman costumes).
Upon returning to the shop, they meet several living glass figurines in a Christmas village: Pip, Cordelia, Gary, and a group of carolers. They explain that Pepper is an evil Christmas elf who has tricked Chris into a Faustian bargain, and that they are all previous victims of hers. Chris has to find five golden rings held by the missing images, now alive, before 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve or else he will turn into a figurine as well.
Chris and Holly acquire the first two rings from the two turtledoves and the three French hens. Then he rescues the figurines, taking them home in the village's clock tower, where he shows them to his family.
At Chris's older daughter Joy's track meet, Pepper has the eight maids milking and ten lords leaping attack the family. Despite the chaos, they manage to retrieve the third and fourth rings. Joy, however, becomes upset when her father inadvertently insults a college recruiter, leading her and her brother Nick to accuse him of focusing on Christmas for his own sake and not letting them live their own lives.
Back at home, Chris reveals what is going on, so the family resolves to help. Realizing that Pepper has the fifth ring, they set up a trap for her during the night of the competition, where everyone learns from Prism Cable's news program that the $100,000 reward is actually in taco coupons.
After trapping Pepper and getting her ring, Santa Claus appears to send her back to the North Pole. When Chris presents the five rings to her, she taunts him, saying he needs more. As ""five golden rings"" is said eight times in ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"", the family realize they need 40 rings.
Pepper then unleashes the remaining decorations (the nine ladies dancing are unseen) on the neighborhood. The Carvers scramble to get the rings, with Santa assisting them. Pepper then cheats by turning the clock tower forward five minutes, prematurely turning Chris into a figurine. The family only manages to get 38 rings, but Santa points out that Chris and Carol's wedding rings, bring the total to 40, turning Chris back to normal. Holly then has the other figurines returned to normal as her Christmas wish. Santa takes Pepper and all the former figurines except for Pip on his sleigh, saying goodbye to the Carvers.
On Christmas morning, the Carvers enjoy their free tacos with Bruce and his family, as Chris made amends with him. Pip then arrives, wishing to not spend Christmas alone, and is welcomed by the family.
One year later in the mid-credits, Pepper is then shown to have been turned into a glass figurine by Santa as punishment where her good behavior will get her back to the reindeer poop-scooping rank. Chris has gained ownership of Pepper's store, now renamed ""Chris Kringle's"".

306,Eileen (film),"In Massachusetts during the 1960s, Eileen Dunlop is a young woman working in a corrections facility for teenage boys. At work, Eileen is shunned by her colleagues and fantasizes about one of the guards. At home, Eileen lives with her widowed and alcoholic father, Jim, a former chief of police who suffers from paranoia and is emotionally abusive towards her. Eileen frequently daydreams about killing herself and her father.
A new psychologist, Rebecca Saint John, joins the prison staff. Eileen is immediately drawn to Rebecca's intellectual conversation and glamorous appearance. Rebecca begins working with an inmate, Lee Polk, who was imprisoned for stabbing his father to death. Rebecca invites Lee's mother, Rita, to speak with her and Lee, but Rita soon leaves distraught after Lee refuses to speak with her. That evening, Rebecca invites Eileen to a local bar. Following a night of drinking and dancing, Rebecca kisses Eileen before leaving.
The next morning, Eileen wakes in her car to find that Jim has locked her out of the house. As she cleans vomit from the seat of her car, a local policeman arrives to inform her that the neighbors have raised complaints about Jim's violent and erratic behavior. As a consequence, Jim has agreed to relinquish his gun into Eileen's care. At work, Eileen is upset to learn that Rebecca has already left for the Christmas holiday. Eileen spends the day sleeping on Rebecca's desk.
On Christmas Eve, Eileen receives a call from Rebecca, inviting her to her house for drinks. When Eileen arrives, they share a drink, but a panicked Rebecca eventually reveals that they are actually in the Polks' house. Rebecca, suspecting that Lee was sexually abused by his father, had arrived to question Rita. The conversation became heated and, following a scuffle during which they fell into the basement, Rebecca tied Rita up and drugged her. She now plans to coerce Rita into admitting involvement in her son's abuse, with Eileen as a witness. Eileen reluctantly agrees to help, retrieving her father's gun from her car.
In the basement, Rita breaks down after being threatened by Eileen. She admits that, although initially oblivious to her husband's abuse of Lee, she eventually became aware after walking in on her husband in Lee's room. Feeling powerless to stop the abuse, and enjoying her husband's renewed interest in her, Rita instead enabled her husband by giving Lee an enema and bathing him before he went to bed.
As Rita finishes her story, Eileen shoots her in the shoulder; Eileen and Rebecca drug Rita into unconsciousness. Amid Rebecca's unease, Eileen suggests framing Jim for the shooting and running away together, confessing her love for Rebecca. The two load Rita into Eileen's car, and agree to meet at Eileen's house. Rebecca does not show up, and as dawn breaks, Eileen drives to a remote forest and leaves the still-drugged Rita in her car, which fills with engine smoke. Eileen then returns to the main road and hitches a ride, smiling to herself as she leaves the town.

307,The Shift (2023 film),"In 2008, hedge fund manager Kevin Garner is fired following the collapse of Bear Stearns. Kevin goes to a bar, where he meets a woman named Molly, who approaches him on a dare from her friends. The two hit it off and get married. Years later, Kevin and Molly are now estranged following the death of their son, Daniel. Molly has become an embittered alcoholic and Kevin is unhappy in his job, as he works for a much younger boss, Brendan. Brendan hates Kevin because his parents lost their home in the subprime mortgage crisis. After learning he will be fired, Kevin leaves work and is in a car accident. Kevin is apparently pulled from the wreck by a mysterious stranger who identifies himself only as ""The Benefactor"". The Benefactor tells Kevin that he has actually ""shifted"" him to another reality following the accident, and that they are in a parallel universe.
The Benefactor and Kevin go to a café, and Kevin sees that all the patrons inside are terrified of the Benefactor. After a tense conversation at the table, Kevin realizes that the Benefactor is actually Satan. The Benefactor offers Kevin anything he wants so long as he works as one of his ""shifters"", people who have sold their souls and use ""shifting"" to torment souls by transferring them to other realities. Kevin is skeptical and asks him to prove it, and the Benefactor ""shifts"" a waitress, Tina, to an alternate reality where she never existed. After realizing this action will drive Tina insane, Kevin refuses the offer and prays to God for help. Enraged, the Benefactor abruptly vanishes, leaving Kevin trapped in the dystopian alternate universe. Horrified at what he just did, Kevin apologizes to Tina's family and leaves.
Five years later, Kevin is still in the totalitarian reality, living under an assumed name because he refused the Benefactor. Kevin attempts to replicate whatever Bible passages he remembers and distributes them through his friend Gabriel, despite scripture being illegal. Kevin also shares the story of Job with his neighbor, Rajit, and his family. Kevin explains that this reality suffered from constant war until the Benefactor arrived and made a new world in his image. Because most of the planet is destroyed from war, the majority of people live in squalid, poverty-stricken cities ruled with an iron fist by the Benefactor's secret police. Kevin's only solace is going to a movie theater owned by Russo, which plays a live feed from alternate realities.
In the theater, Kevin sees several versions of Molly, one of which is a single mother working as a nurse. Kevin plans to acquire the shifting technology from a ""shifter"", but their identities are secret. Kevin then learns that the Benefactor is returning to the reality for the first time in five years. He acquires an illegal firearm from Gabriel and attempts to force the Benefactor to take him back to his life. However, the plan fails and, after Kevin refuses another deal, the Benefactor disappears once again. The secret police shoot Rajit, wounding him severely, and kill Gabriel. Kevin realizes that Gabriel was secretly a shifter, and takes his device, shifting himself to another reality.
Kevin shifts to multiple universes, coming across Tina, who is unhinged and in a psych ward. After he is rejected by a version of Molly, the Benefactor returns Kevin to the totalitarian universe and he shifts Tina to the theater and tells him that he can choose to return Tina to her family and never see Molly again, or he can sell his soul to him and he can be with Molly forever. Kevin denies the Benefactor's offer and gives Tina her life back, and Kevin is suddenly shifted to another reality. In this reality, Molly is the nurse and single mother he saw previously. He strikes up a conversation similar to how they first met, and the two get married once again. Kevin states that this is not his universe, but it is his home. Kevin is then shown playing with his newborn son and his adopted daughter, proving that he was given double what he lost.

312,Origin (film),"Grappling with tremendous personal tragedy, writer Isabel Wilkerson sets herself on a path of global investigation and discovery as she writes Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents.
Wilkerson is consulted for her opinion after the shooting of Trayvon Martin. She explores the idea of how race may not be the only determining factor in bigotry, since, e.g., in India, everyone may be of the same ""race"", but bigotry still occurs by caste. Similarly, although Jews of European descent may have been considered ""White"" in some parts of the world, in Nazi Germany they were defined as an inferior race to be exterminated. Wilkerson visits Germany and debates friends about how slavery compared with the Holocaust, ""subjugation"" versus ""extermination"".
Wilkerson chats at a cocktail party with two White women who are friendly, but do not fully understand her ideas and how different types of bigotry interrelate. Later, she works with one of the women on her book.
Intertwined with her ideas and discoveries, Wilkerson suffers the loss of her husband Brett, a White man; her elderly mother Ruby; and her cousin Marion. She often imagines herself speaking to those who have passed away, such as Al Bright, a Black boy who was on a winning Little League team, but when the team was invited to a swimming-pool party, he was not allowed to enter the water.
Wilkerson looks in German archives and discovers that the Nazis used some of America's racist laws to develop some of their own racist laws. The history of a couple in Nazi Germany is related, a Gentile Nazi-party member man who has a romance with a Jewish woman. They try to escape Germany, but she is caught and sent to a camp.
Also told is the story of married Black researchers Allison and Elizabeth Davis, who work with a White couple, Burleigh and Mary Gardner, in an undercover project to find about segregation in America, resulting in the 1941 book Deep South. A lynching of a Black man is shown, with a White audience watching, some of them treating it as a show.
Wilkerson eventually decides to write a book about caste, a concept which solves some of the intellectual problems which mere consideration of race does not. She visits India and the home, now a historical site, of Dr. Ambedkar, who championed Dalit (""untouchable"") rights. Eventually she speaks about her new book Caste on stage, and how it makes it easier to understand and fight bigotry.
Finally, words on the screen note Caste became a number one New York Times nonfiction best-seller around the time of the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, and spent ample time on the best-sellers list.

313,Diary of a Wimpy Kid Christmas: Cabin Fever,"It's Christmas time, and Greg is trying to remain good so that he can get the new video game console, the Mega Station 9000. He has two weeks left as his mother, Susan, attempts to put the family in the holiday spirit. She introduces them to Elfrendo, a creepy stuffed elf doll that her grandmother made when she was a kid, and who supposedly watches their every move for Santa and becomes a source of annoyance for Greg.
To remain good, Greg gets Rowley to build a snowman with him, but create a snowball that is so large that it rips up the lawn. Down the street, a snowplow woman is accosted by children. Greg and Rowley accidentally knock their large snowball down the street that damages the snowplow's blade. The two of them run from the woman and lose her. Knowing they will be identified by their clothing items, they drop them off in a dumpster. When they return home, Susan forces the family into a Christmas drive through town where Greg learns that the dumpster was actually a toy donation bin. The next day, wanted posters of the ""assailants"" are posted everywhere and Greg and Rowley plan to get their things back.
The next day, a snowstorm has snowed everyone in, just as Greg's dad Frank was worrying about it. The family is forced to remain indoors until the storm passes which could take days; this is made all the more difficult when the power goes out. Greg feels better when he finds that his family did get him his game console, but starts to succumb to family tension. Susan tries to invigorate everyone's holiday spirit, Frank attempts to keep inventory, though he notices things are suddenly missing, and Rodrick tries to power the doorbell camera in an attempt to find the snowball culprits, after falsely assuming that two high schoolers stole Greg and Rowley's things and caused the snowplow damage. The family begins to suffer from cabin fever and start arguing with one another, made worse when their water pipes burst. When Manny goes missing, the family search for him and find that he has been hoarding much of their supplies.
The Heffleys finally calm down and seeing as how it is Christmas Eve decide to open one present early, making everyone feel better. Greg expects his early present to be the video game console, though finds it to be clothing items from his grandmother instead. They notice that it has stopped snowing and Greg sneaks out to enact his plan. He recruits Rowley and they make their way to the toy donation bin, though they have to dig furiously for it due to the snow. Greg finds their things, but Rowley abandons him when the snowplow lady from earlier arrives. She is impressed with Greg having shoveled all the snow and offers him a ride back to his house. Greg learns that she is a single mother who only does snow plowing as a side job to support her and her son, Tyler. She wanted to get him a Mega Station, but cannot afford it. Greg leaves on good terms with her, even though she spots the clothing items he retrieved, she calls him a ""good kid"" and they part.
Greg returns just as the power returns to the neighborhood and the family celebrate. They see a police officer vehicle pull up and realize that Greg is the snowball culprit. The Heffleys instead decide to hide the evidence, but Greg decides to turn himself in. It turns out that the police were simply looking for donations and Greg decides to give up his Mega Station to the snowplow woman and Tyler.

317,Craig Before the Creek,"Craig Williams has just moved to Herkleton with his family and already feels displaced. After a rough night, Nicole tells Craig to take his younger sister Jessica to the playground. While playing on the swings, Jessica's stuffed toy, Small Uncle, accidentally gets flung into the Creek and Craig ventures in for the first time to get it. He encounters all the strange kids including trading kid Kit who just so happens to have it. The kids are attacked by a pirate crew led by Serena who intimidates Craig and takes Small Uncle. Craig is rescued by a fantasy obsessed girl named Kelsey, and her pet parakeet Mortimer, but after that, she demands to be paid, which Craig does so in Choco-rolls.
Later that night, Craig finds a diary in his room that belonged to the previous occupant Hannah, who reveals that she hid a wish maker somewhere in the Creek to hide from people like Serena. Craig resolves to find it so that he can wish for his old life back. He recruits Kelsey who reluctantly comes along. The two get a raft from Kit and venture down the Creek before encountering Serena and her pirates who imprison them. They encounter a gawky boy named J.P. who is a ""torturer"" in that nobody wants to be around him as he is bad at being bad. Serena reveals that she wants the wish maker so that she can flood the Creek. With J.P. switching sides, he, Craig, and Kelsey stage an escape.
Serena convinces her crew to stay through the dinner horn while Craig, Kelsey, and J.P. hide in a tree stump and phone each other's parents to make it seem like they are having a sleepover. Kelsey and J.P. reveal that if they get to wish anything, they want people to understand them. As they sleep, Craig gets up and decides to continue his quest alone. Kelsey and J.P. wake up to discover Craig's deception, but are captured by Serena's crew. Craig finds the ancient playground and opens a hidden entrance to an underground temple-like area where he finds the wish maker. As he performs the commands to get a wish, he starts to reflect on his time with Kelsey and J.P. Just then, Serena arrives with her crew and takes the wish maker.
Serena's wish is granted as the Creek suddenly begins to flood, but her crew abandons her out of fear and she is washed away. Craig, Kelsey, and J.P. take Serena's ship and after a motivational speech from Craig, the group steer the ship and find the wish maker on a rock along with Serena. While Craig activates the wish maker, Kelsey battles Serena, but she grabs it just as Craig finishes. Craig and Serena are transported to inside the wish maker where they battle each other using other kids' wishes. Craig later finds Serena's true wish, which was to return to her oceanside town which she was forced to move away from. Realizing that they shared the same wish, Craig convinces her to move on. The two of them wish for the Creek to be saved.
The rains stop as the Creek returns to normal, but the wish maker is destroyed. The kids all return to playing at the Creek with Serena's former pirate crew now acting nicer to the other kids. Serena decides to continue exploring the Creek on her own as Craig finally returns Small Uncle to a thankful Jessica. He further writes a thank you letter to Hannah and mails her diary back to her. Craig, now with a new appreciation for the Creek and his friends, meets up with Kelsey and J.P. and suggests that they continue having adventures in the Creek so that they can draw a map of their own.

318,Wonka (film),"Willy Wonka, an aspiring magician, inventor, and chocolatier, arrives in Europe to establish his chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. After using up his meager savings, he is coerced to stay at Mrs. Scrubitt's boardinghouse by her henchman, Bleacher. Despite orphan Noodle's warning about reading the fine print, Wonka signs the contract because he is illiterate. To pay them off, Wonka attempts to sell ""hoverchocs"", chocolates that make people fly, facing mockery from three rival chocolatiers who call the chief of police to confiscate his earnings for selling chocolates without owning a proper shop.
Unable to pay the expensive fees imposed on him by the contract, Wonka is captured and forced to work in a launderette for Mrs. Scrubitt alongside other captives, Abacus Crunch, Piper Benz, Lottie Bell, and Larry Chucklesworth. Wonka escapes with the help of Noodle after they trick Bleacher and Scrubbit into falling in love with each other. Wonka promises Noodle a lifetime supply of chocolates, and she promises to teach him how to read. Wonka tells Noodle that his affinity for chocolate stems from his late mother. He also mentions the theft of his chocolates by an enigmatic orange man who has been stealing them for years. To produce his signature chocolate, Wonka and Noodle travel to the local zoo, milking Abigail the giraffe. After a run in with the chief of police, Wonka and Noodle learn from Abacus of the ""chocolate cartel"" who work together to stow their chocolate in a vault underneath the cathedral; the cartel leader Arthur Slugworth had previously fired Abacus as his accountant. Wonka and his new friends embark on a chocolate-selling crusade to alleviate their debts while using sewage tunnels underneath the city to evade Scrubitt, the police, and the chief. Wonka encounters an Oompa Loompa named Lofty after trapping him in a jar; the Oompa Loompa seeks reimbursement for the cocoa beans that Wonka unknowingly stole from Loompaland years earlier under Lofty's watch, resulting in Lofty's exile.
Wonka opens his dream chocolate store. The chief and the chocolate cartel, who are now unable to arrest him since he has a legitimate shop, reveal Wonka's shop to Scrubitt and Bleacher. They poison his chocolates with ingredients that cause hair to grow and change color. As a result, the shop's furious customers ransack Wonka's store and cause a fire that destroys the establishment. Wonka agrees to the cartel's offer to leave town by ship to pay off everyone's debts. All of Scrubbitt's captives are freed, except Noodle, as Slugworth pays Scrubitt to keep her there indefinitely. On the boat, Wonka learns that Noodle is Slugworth's niece, daughter of his late brother Zebedee, just before learning the boat is rigged to explode. Wonka rescues Noodle with the help of the group and they divise a strategy to obtain the cartel's incriminating account book.
Wonka and Noodle infiltrate the cartel's base. They are confronted by the cartel leaders, with Slugworth revealing that he sent Noodle, who was reported dead to her mother, Dorothy, to Scrubitt in order to eliminate her claim to the family fortune. Wonka gives Slugworth the jar of hoverchocs to give to Lofty if he finds him. The cartel then locks Wonka and Noodle in the vault and attempts to drown them in chocolate, but Lofty rescues them and they expose the cartel's misdeeds to the authorities and the public. Wonka's friends release the cartel's chocolate reserve through a fountain, now laced with Wonka's unique ingredients, ruining the cartel's enterprise. The cartel meets their downfall as they float away, and the police arrest the corrupt chief. Wonka unwraps the last chocolate bar his mother had given him, discovering a golden paper with a message saying 'what matters is who you share the chocolate with', so he shares it with his friends. He later helps Noodle in reuniting with Dorothy at the library, settles his debt with Lofty, and finds an abandoned castle for sale. Wonka builds and opens his very own chocolate factory, with Lofty joining him as a tasting chef.
In a mid-credits scene, Lofty narrates how Wonka’s friends returned to their old lives and shows Scrubitt and Bleacher being arrested after their attempt to eliminate the evidence of sabotaging Wonka's shop by drinking it backfires.

319,Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget,"Since the chickens escaped from Mr and Mrs Tweedy's Farm,[a] they have settled in an idyllic sanctuary on an island in a lake, where they can live happily, safe from humans. Ginger and Rocky start a family with a hatchling named Molly. The rats Nick and Fetcher visit periodically with supplies.
Molly grows into an adventurous 11-year-old, whom Ginger and Rocky try to protect from the outside world. The appearance of trucks and construction on the mainland concern Ginger that another chicken farm is being built, and with her more cautious perspective as a parent, she leads her community in better hiding themselves.
Molly's curiosity draws her to sneak away to the mainland, where she is saved from being run over by a teenage chicken named Frizzle. The two friends stow away on a truck full of chickens being taken to Fun-Land Farms, which looks appealing to them. Ginger and Rocky form a search party with chickens Babs, Bunty, Mac, and Fowler; they give chase and find that the ""farm"" is a highly-advanced poultry processing plant bristling with security systems.
Inside, Molly and Frizzle find an expansive amusement area, where the other chickens – all wearing numbered electronic collars – go on rides, play games, etc. Rocky impulsively catapults into the compound, inadvertently activating various security systems, giving Ginger and the others the info they need to infiltrate. They are joined by Nick and Fetcher, who are separated from the others, but meet up with Rocky.
Molly and Frizzle discover that the collars turn the other chickens into carefree idiots when activated. Frizzle is caught by the facility's scientist Dr Fry and given a collar; Molly leaves, promising to come back for her.
Ginger reunites with Molly, and learns in horror that her nemesis Mrs Tweedy is running the operation alongside Dr Fry, her new husband. The collars serve to suppress the chickens' fear, to make tastier chicken nuggets for Reginald Smith, a fast-food chain businessman looking for new food items. Mrs Tweedy captures Ginger and puts a collar on her, which she resists unsuccessfully, but Rocky intervenes and Molly frees her. The hens, rooster, and rats are reunited in a corn silo, which they escape by turning it into popcorn. Molly mourns the fate of Frizzle, prompting Ginger and the others to turn back and help the other chickens as well.
Mrs Tweedy orders Dr Fry to start production of chicken nuggets, beginning a struggle for the remote control that brainwashes the chickens, between Mrs Tweedy and the team of Rocky, Ginger, and Molly, while the rest of the rescue squad try to hold back the chickens marching mindlessly into the processor. The chicken trio win the fight, sending Mrs Tweedy into the machine to be breaded like a chicken nugget, while the whole population of chickens and the rats escape in a truck. Mrs Tweedy tries to stop them, but Fowler knocks her into the compound's moat, where she is stopped by the facility's security, as the site explodes from the chickens' sabotage.
The chickens return to the island, and their life returns to normal, now with Molly and Frizzle doing aerial reconnaissance for chicken farms on the mainland, and the chicken crew liberating those they find.

320,Rebel Moon,"Atticus Noble, the sadistic admiral of the militaristic Imperium, arrives on the backwater moon of Veldt on behalf of the Motherworld, an interstellar empire fueled by centuries of conquest and war. He explains that his troops are hunting for a band of rebels led by siblings Devra and Darrian Bloodaxe, and offers to buy the village's surplus grain. The village's leader, Sindri, refuses the offer, claiming they barely have enough to survive. A farmer, Gunnar, contradicts Sindri's claim, indicating that the village might have some surplus. Noble kills Sindri and orders Gunnar to prepare enough grain—which will not leave the village with enough to survive—in ten weeks. Noble departs, leaving a handful of soldiers—including Private Aris, who is disillusioned with the Imperium and Motherworld's immorality—and a ""Jimmy"" robot to oversee the harvest. After being harassed by a peer, Jimmy starts to become independent. One villager, Kora, finds the other soldiers holding another villager and Aris hostage—preparing to gang rape the former—, and kills them with help from Jimmy, who has defected from the soldiers. Kora warns the villagers that Noble will massacre the village once he returns, unless they mount a defense.
Kora and Gunnar depart for the port town of Providence to recruit warriors for the village's defense, including Titus, a disgraced Imperium general. During their journey, she reveals to Gunnar that she once served the Imperium as a soldier, having been adopted and renamed to Arthelais by Balisarius, an Imperium commander, after he killed her family and eradicated her home planet's population. She became bodyguard to Motherworld princess Issa, who was expected to usher in an end to the Imperium's conquests. She was unable to protect Issa during her coronation, when the royal family was assassinated, and Balisarius subsequently declared himself regent before renewing its conquests.
Arriving at Providence, the pair meets smuggler and criminal Kai, who agrees to take them to recruit Titus. On the way, Kai takes them to two additional warriors: Tarak, a beast tamer, and Nemesis, a talented swordswoman enhanced by cybernetics. The group arrives at a gladiator on a remote moon, finding Titus in a drunken stupor. Titus initially refuses, but agrees to join them after Kora suggests that he avenge his fallen soldiers. Using Gunnar's previous dealings with the Bloodaxes, they then arrive at planet Sharaan to meet them and their rebellion, intending to recruit them. Darrian agrees to defend the village and brings with him a handful of rebels, including Millius, one rebel, with him, while Devra considers a fight against Noble's dreadnought, the King's Gaze, hopeless and a waste of their resources. After they depart Sharaan, Noble arrives and eradicates its population as punishment for assisting the rebels.
Kai tells Kora that he has been moved by her quest to abandon his illicit life as a smuggler and that he has one last shipment to drop off to leave that life behind him. He takes the group to a trading post at which Noble's ship has arrived and restrains them—save for Gunnar—, betraying them to Noble and revealing he had always intended to do so for the bounties on their heads. Noble identifies Kora, Tarak, Nemesis and Titus for their history—Kora and Titus as deserters, Tarak as a criminal and former prince, and Nemesis as the killer of several Imperial officers in revenge for her murdered children. Kai demands that Gunnar paralyze Kora; Gunnar instead frees her and kills Kai. The other warriors are unshackled as well. A battle ensues, with Darrian and Noble—the latter at the hands of Kora—among its casualties. Afterwards, the surviving warriors return to Veldt together, with Jimmy watching them from afar on their way to the village.
Noble's corpse is recovered by Motherworld forces, and he is resurrected after having spoken on an astral plane with Balisarius,[12] who demands that Noble end the insurgency against him and bring Kora to him alive so he can execute her himself.

321,American Fiction (film),"Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison is a highly intelligent and articulate African-American upper-class writer and professor in Los Angeles. His novels receive academic praise, but sell poorly, and the publishers reject his latest manuscript for not being ""black enough"". His university places him on temporary leave due to his brashness with students over racial issues and suggests he attend a literary seminar and spend time with family in his hometown, Boston. At the seminar, Monk sees low attendance at his panel, yet there is a packed room for the panel of Sintara Golden, whose bestselling novel in Ebonics, We's Lives in Da Ghetto, panders to black stereotypes.
In Boston, Monk bonds with his mother Agnes, who shows signs of Alzheimer's disease, and sister Lisa, a medical doctor but a heavy smoker. Lisa suffers a heart attack while having drinks with Monk and dies in the hospital.
Monk's estranged brother, Cliff, who is also an MD, attends Lisa's funeral. Cliff is divorced after his wife caught him cheating with a man; he now abuses drugs and alcohol. Monk meets and starts dating Coraline, a lawyer living across the street.
Frustrated by Sintara's success and the costs of care for his mother, Monk writes My Pafology, a satirical novel mocking the literary cliches expected from black writers; melodramatic plots, badly written dialogue in Ebonics, deadbeat dads, gang violence, and drugs. After submitting it to publishers out of contempt, he is shocked to be offered a $750,000 advance, and his agent Arthur convinces him to adopt the persona of former convict ""Stagg R. Leigh"". As ""Stagg"", Monk is offered a movie deal from producer Wiley. In response to insulting comments from publishing executives, Monk attempts to sabotage the deal by demanding the title be changed to Fuck. Unexpectedly, the executives agree. Monk is invited to help judge the New England Book Association's Literary Award as part of a ""diversity push"", and he reluctantly accepts. One fellow judge is Sintara and Monk is surprised to learn she shares many of his views.
Agnes moves into an assisted-living facility, but adapts poorly. Cliff briefly returns to Boston, but leaves after Agnes makes an anti-gay remark. Fuck becomes a bestseller. Coraline, Cliff, and the public remain unaware that ""Stagg"" is Monk, and the FBI contacts the publisher, believing that Stagg is a fugitive as he has claimed in interviews.
On family housekeeper Lorraine's wedding day, Monk finds Cliff living in Agnes's beach house with two other men: Cliff never left Boston, and has been partying and doing drugs, but Lorraine is happy to have him attend the wedding, where Monk will walk her down the aisle. At the reception, Monk and Cliff discuss the legacy of their father after his suicide, and Cliff encourages Monk to let people ""love all of him"".
Monk's publisher submits Fuck for the literary award, forcing him to judge his own novel. The panel's white Limousine liberal judges rave over Fuck, though Sintara calls the book ""pandering"". Monk agrees, but later argues that Sintara's book is ""trauma porn"" and inauthentic to her African-American middle-class background. Sintara argues that she extensively researched her book by interviewing voiceless people, and is ""giving the market what it wants"", and claims that it is not her fault if white readers form stereotypes from her book. Monk is even more offended when he finds that Coraline enjoyed reading Fuck; they argue heatedly and break up.
At the award ceremony, Monk goes on stage after Fuck is announced as the winner and says he has a confession to make. The screen cuts to black: the story is revealed to be Monk's screenplay based on his experiences, written for Wiley's production company as an alternative to the Fuck film adaptation. Monk has not revealed his identity to the public, and is still separated from Coraline. Wiley likes the screenplay but asks Monk to write a different ending.
The film portrays different endings, including one in which police fatally shoot Monk at the ceremony. Wiley—also busy filming blaxploitation film Plantation Annihilation—loves it, and the film moves into production. Monk drives away with Cliff after he and one of Wiley's actors, playing a slave, acknowledge each other.

322,The Family Plan,"Dan Morgan is a gifted car salesman living quietly in the Buffalo suburbs with his wife Jessica and their three kids, teens, Nina and Kyle, and infant child Max. Dan is content with his low key life, and dislikes violence, technology and social media. Meanwhile, Jessica yearns for more spontaneity and excitement.
Dan and Jessica attend the carnival for their anniversary. He has a confrontation when someone purposely takes a selfie with them kissing in the background as a joke, then posts it on his social media. Dan walks away, refusing to engage in a fight.
Soon after, Dan is attacked in a supermarket while shopping with Max, and easily defeats the highly trained attacker. Afterwards, Dan, who is revealed to be an ex assassin, contacts his former associate Augie to find out why it happened. He suggests it is Dan's former employer McCaffrey, and advises him to disappear.
Dan, realizing the carnival photo outed him, orders new passports for him and his family. He retrieves his kids from school and Jessica from work, telling them they're taking a spontaneous road trip to Las Vegas, where he is meeting Augie to collect the new documents.
As they're leaving town, Dan realizes they're being followed and therefore their minivan must have a tracker on it. At work he uses a service bay to find and remove it from the undercarriage.
Meanwhile, McCaffrey and his team search the Morgans' home but can't find their destination, as Dan has covered their tracks. He drives through the night until reaching Iowa City. Excited, Nina begs them to visit Southern Iowa University as she hopes to follow her boyfriend Trevor there, rather than pursue her original goal of attending Stanford. She catches Trevor cheating on her, so Dan teaches her a martial arts moves to use on him.
During a campus tour, Dan notices a German man on his phone, and believes he works for McCaffrey, although he discovers he's mistaken when he's attacked by another of McCaffrey's henchmen. Dan fights the henchman and incapacitates him in a chemistry lab before rejoining his family.
As they travel, the family grows closer. Arriving in Vegas, Dan plans to tell Jessica the truth over a romantic dinner. The teens are to babysit Max in their penthouse suite, but all go down to the HyperX gaming arena, as Kyle is a popular gamer.
When Dan and Jessica return to their suite to check on the kids, McCaffrey's team attacks them. He quickly dispatches them, shocking Jessica. Heading downstairs to retrieve the kids, a shootout ensues and his family witness him kill two more assassins.
Revealing his name to be Sean, Dan finally comes clean to his family, who are outraged. He nevertheless gives them their new IDs, telling them that their lives in Buffalo are over, but Jessica takes the kids and leaves the next morning, believing they aren't in danger. She calls her friend, Gwen, a travel agent who offers to fly them home.
On the private jet, Gwen reveals she works for McCaffrey and is Dan’s ex, who she is angry at for leaving. Handing Jessica and the kids over to him, he takes them hostage. McCaffrey, Dan’s father, threatens to kill them unless Dan accepts his offer to rejoin his team of assassins. He relents, and Jessica and the kids are to return home.
Jessica and the kids escape after she kills their escort, and they go back for Dan. McCaffrey calls his army into the hotel to recapture him. Dan engages the mercenaries, with Kyle helping with a drone. Jessica fights Gwen, culminating in Jessica impaling her with a piece of broken bamboo as a javelin, from her track and field experience. They head downstairs where Nina distracts McCaffrey from killing Dan, giving him time to knock McCaffrey out, and he is taken into custody.
Some time later, the Morgans have returned to their lives in Buffalo; Dan now runs a security firm to train clients how to better defend against attacks while Jessica coaches high school track and field. They then load up a rented RV to embark on a cross-country road trip to take Nina to Stanford.

323,Finestkind,"On a visit to New Bedford, Massachusetts, college alumnus Charlie pays a visit to his elder half-brother Tom Eldrige, a scallop fisherman. Disillusioned with his systematic life, he asks Tom to take him on his upcoming fishing excursion, which he reluctantly agrees to. Sailing out on Excelsior's boat, the Harmony, Charlie is introduced to the crew – Nunes a.k.a “Nunesy”, family man Costa and drug-addict Skeemo. Hours into the voyage, Harmony suffers an explosion on rough seas, causing it to sink; the crew narrowly survive.
Upon being rescued the following morning, the five go to a bar to celebrate their ordeal, where Charlie encounters Mabel, a small-time drug dealer. His wealthy father, Gary Sykes, who tracks him down, attempts to convince him against fishing, but is bluntly rebuffed. Later, the brothers visits Tom’s employers; there, Tom demands to see the maintenance records for the Harmony, but his egoistic boss accuses him of incompetence. Tom throws his boss against the wall and his boss dares Tom to hit him, so that he can press charges. Charlie dissuades Tom from doing so, and the brothers leave.
Later, Tom is approached by his aging father, Ray, who requests him to take his boat, the Finestkind, on a dredging excursion in his place, which Tom reluctantly acquiesces to. Later, at a house party hosted by Costa, Tom informs the others of the assignment; whilst there, Mabel takes Charlie for a drug-run, during which he meets her skeptical mother. After the meeting ends poorly, he crashes at Mabel’s apartment, where the two share a passionate night.  Waking up late the next day, the two learn that Tom is about to leave without him; in response, Mabel rushes Charlie to the harbor, barely making it to the Finestkind just as it leaves for sea. At sea, Tom decides to take the boat discreetly to fish in Canadian waters in the hopes of securing more lucrative catches. The gambit nearly succeeds, but the boat accidentally ensnares itself in its fishing dredge just as a Canadian aircraft locates them, prematurely ending the excursion.
Returning to port, the Finestkind is seized by U.S. authorities, much to the crew’s dismay. Resolving to tell Ray of the incident, the two learn he is hospitalized with terminal stomach cancer – the actual reason for his handing over the boat. Not wanting his father to die without his beloved boat, Tom approaches his former employers to bail him out on the $100,000 fine that had been conditioned  for the boat’s release, but is scornfully rejected. Sympathetic to their plight, Mabel arranges for the crew to participate in a one-time heroin smuggling gig with Weeks, her mother’s partner. Despite the crew’s acceptance, Tom fears of being caught, but is convinced otherwise.
The crew sail out to the drop spot, where a plane delivers the heroin. Returning to port, the brothers head off alone to meet Weeks, but are cornered by a rival drug team, who make away with the heroin after subduing them. Realizing they are betrayed, Tom accuses Mabel of snitching on them, leading to a fight – which is witnessed by Ray. Consequently, Weeks corners the crew at Costa’s home, having taken Costa’s pregnant wife hostage. He forces them to deliver the heroin by the following morning, promising to kill them should they fail; he reveals that he had assaulted Mabel.
After they leave, the crew helps Costa’s wife, whereupon Tom disappears. Whilst searching for him, Ray corners Charlie, who divulges their quagmire. The next morning, Charlie meets Nunesy, who tells him that Tom had taken a pistol with him to see Skeemo. Realizing Skeemo was the snitch, Charlie races over to his place, arriving just as Tom is about to execute him. Nevertheless, Charlie manages to convince him otherwise, opting to take their chances instead. Elsewhere, Ray appears at Weeks’ meeting point with an offer of $15,000 in exchange for leaving the crew alone. When Weeks refuses and proceeds to mock him, Ray shoots him dead – just as the brothers arrive. Ray explains to an emotionally-moved Tom that he would do anything to save him.
Gary agrees to pay the fine on the boat, realizing he cannot change his son, whilst Mabel prepares to enter college. Finally free, the crew prepare to sail on the Finestkind once more, while an incarcerated, yet happy Ray watches from a distance.

324,The Zone of Interest (film),"In 1943, Rudolf Höss, commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, lives with his wife Hedwig and their five children in an idyllic home next to the camp. Höss takes the children out to swim and fish, and Hedwig spends time tending the garden. Servants handle chores and the prisoners' belongings are given to the family. Beyond the garden wall, gunshots, shouting and sounds of trains and furnaces sound.
Höss approves the design of a new crematorium, which soon becomes operational. Höss notices human remains in the river. He gets his children out of the water and sends a note to camp personnel, chastising them for their carelessness.
Höss receives word that he is being promoted to deputy inspector of all concentration camps and must relocate to Oranienburg near Berlin. He objects to no avail and withholds the news from Hedwig for several days. Hedwig, deeply attached to their home, begs him to convince his superiors to let her and the children remain. The request is approved and Höss moves.
Hedwig's mother comes to stay, but is horrified at the sight of the flames of the crematorium at night and departs, leaving behind a note that Hedwig discards. A Polish girl who lives nearby sneaks out every night, hiding food at the prisoners' work sites for them to find and eat.
Months after arriving in Berlin, in recognition of his work, Höss is tasked with heading an operation named after him that will transport hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz to be killed. This allows him to move back to Auschwitz and reunite with his family. He vacantly attends a party celebrating the operation, and tells Hedwig over the phone that he spent his time there thinking about the most efficient way to gas the room.
As Höss leaves his Berlin office, he stops and retches repeatedly but is unable to vomit. In the present, a group of janitors clean the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum before it opens. In Berlin, Höss descends a dark stairway.

326,Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,"Four years after becoming king of Atlantis,[a] Arthur Curry has married Mera and had a son, Arthur Jr., while splitting his life between land and sea. Meanwhile, David Kane / Black Manta continues to seek revenge against Arthur for his father's death, working with marine biologist Stephen Shin to find Atlantean artifacts. When Shin accidentally discovers a cavern in Antarctica, Manta finds a Black Trident that possesses him, its creator promising to give him the power to destroy Arthur.
Five months later, Manta attacks Atlantis and breaks into its Orichalcum reserves to steal them to power his Atlantean machines that are ancient but are of unknown design to modern Atlanteans. They are caught midway and chased by Atlantean forces, with Mera injured in the ensuing battle. Arthur learns that this usage of Orichalcum, which emits high quantities of greenhouse gases, has not only raised planetary temperatures and caused extreme weather and ocean acidification but nearly caused a planetary extinction in the past when used by an ancient Atlantean kingdom. To learn where Manta is hiding, Arthur breaks his half-brother Orm out of prison, and they visit a pirate haven called the Sunken Citadel, meeting Kingfish to learn of Manta's whereabouts. The information they obtain leads them to a volcanic island in the South Pacific, where they battle Manta's forces after getting themselves through flora and fauna mutated by the Orichalcum. There, Orm comes into contact with the Black Trident, which shows him visions of its provenance. Orm learns the trident was created by Kordax, the brother of King Atlan and ruler of the lost kingdom of Necrus. Kordax was imprisoned with blood magic following a failed attempt to usurp the throne.

327,Migration (2023 film),"In a New England forest, Mack Mallard constantly discourages his kids Dax and Gwen from venturing into the outside world much to the displeasure of his wife Pam.
One day, the Mallards meet a flock of migrating ducks who are en route south to Jamaica which the family finds interesting, but Mack has no such interest. Pam tells Mack that he must open his eyes to the world outside him. That night, Mack talks with his aging Uncle Dan who also does not want to leave the pond. However, Uncle Dan makes Mack second-guess his stance and he decides to let his family migrate, with Uncle Dan joining them at Gwen's behest, but they end up going north instead of south.
During a rainstorm, they take up shelter in a swamp underneath a boardwalk where they encounter a crazed elderly great blue heron named Erin, who brings them to her shack to spend the night with herself and her husband Harry. Despite their frightening disposition, the herons prove their good intentions by saving Dax and Gwen from a catfish.
The following day, the Mallards arrive in New York City where Uncle Dan wanders off and ends up getting the ducks in trouble with a flock of pigeons, led by the gritty Chump, but Pam's assertiveness puts them in Chump's good graces. Chump leads them to her friend Delroy, a macaw who is from Jamaica but lives caged by a human Chef named Taiyee that owns him. Wanting to set Delroy free, Mack and Pam infiltrate the restaurant where Chef Taiyee works to acquire a key to his cage. After evading the humans, they manage to get the key and free Delroy who gratefully guides them to Jamaica.
While Gwen stops for a bathroom break, Mack discovers an entrance to a paradise full of pekins. The group begins to enjoy themselves but Dax soon finds out the whole place is a duck farm, with Chef Taiyee from earlier being one of its clients. Dax helps the pekins and his family escape the farm, but he loses his wing feathers after being stepped on by Chef Taiyee, rendering him flightless. The birds stop to rest at a resort where Mack chastises Dax for his recklessness, making an angered Dax disown his father.
Soon, Chef Taiyee finds the birds via helicopter and traps them in a net while Dax and Gwen manage to hide. Inside, Chef Taiyee plans to kill Mack and Pam first, prompting Pam to give into despair only for Mack to raise her spirits. Using a salsa dance they learned at the restaurant, they attempt to push a button to release the birds, but Taiyee catches them in the act. At this point, Delroy has finally had enough and he, Uncle Dan, and the pekins pelt Taiyee with fruits and vegetables. Chef Taiyee is knocked unconscious by a squash, hitting a button that causes the helicopter to drop out Pam and Mack, still stuck in their cage. They are saved and freed by their kids with Dax having fixed his wings using some of the other birds' feathers. Both father and son silently reconcile.
Now led by Dax, the birds eventually arrive in Jamaica where Delroy reunites with his own friends and the Mallards catch up with the duck family who visited their pond earlier. The following spring, the family is about to head for home when Mack shows them a group of lost penguins that need to get to the South Pole.

328,Anyone but You,"While trying to secure a restroom key at a coffee shop, Boston University law student Bea meets Goldman Sachs employee Ben. The two have an instant connection and spend the day together, ultimately falling asleep on Ben's couch. She leaves without waking him in the morning, but reconsiders and returns to the apartment, only to overhear him insulting her while talking to his friend Pete.
Bea and Ben do not see each other again for six months, crossing paths when Bea's sister, Halle, begins dating Pete's sister, Claudia. The two are frosty towards each other, each blaming the other for their date ending poorly. Halle and Claudia later become engaged, and plan a wedding in Sydney.
Bea, who has broken up with her fiancé Jonathan and secretly dropped out of law school, is dismayed to find that Ben is not only on the same flight to Australia as her, but that they will both be staying at Claudia and Pete's parents' house in the days leading up to the wedding. Bea and Ben's disdain for each other begins to frustrate the other members of the wedding party, compounded by the appearances of Jonathan and Ben's ex-girlfriend Margaret.
While Bea's parents attempt to push her to reconcile with Jonathan, the other attendees devise a plan to get Bea and Ben together to ensure the wedding goes off smoothly. Bea quickly sees through the scheme, and makes a deal with Ben to pretend that they are together in order to both make Margaret jealous and stop Bea's parents pushing her to make up with Jonathan.
Early efforts to sell the relationship are unsuccessful until a party on a boat, where Bea and Ben dance together and reenact a scene from Titanic, which ends in Bea falling into Sydney Harbour. Ben jumps in after Bea, and they have a conversation while waiting for rescue on a buoy. She tells him that she has withdrawn from law school, and they make a date to sightsee at the Sydney Opera House. They return to the house and have sex, but Bea suggests offhandedly that her recent actions have all been mistakes, which disappoints Ben. He slips away in the night, disheartening Bea.
The morning of the wedding, Margaret asks Bea for her blessing to rekindle things with Ben. Bea accepts, claiming that she was only situationally involved with him. Through a conversation with Pete, Ben indirectly reveals to Bea's parents that she has secretly quit law school, leaving her feeling betrayed.
After overhearing Halle and Claudia arguing, Ben convinces Bea to pretend to reconcile for the sake of the wedding. The ceremony goes smoothly but she sees Margaret kissing Ben during the reception and leaves in tears, heading to the Opera House. However, Ben rejects Margaret and says that he no longer has feelings for her as he was wrongfully stuck on a memory. The wedding party convinces him to chase after Bea, so he jumps off the nearby cliff and into the Pacific Ocean, then convinces the rescue helicopter that retrieves him to fly him to the Opera House.
Ben apologizes to Bea, telling her that he left because he feared their relationship could become another regret. They reconcile and return to the reception as a couple, where Halle and Claudia reveal that their argument was yet another ruse to push Bea and Ben towards each other. Meanwhile, Jonathan and Margaret get together.

329,The Iron Claw (film),"In 1979, Texas NWA Heavyweight Champion Kevin Von Erich worries that his father, WCCW owner Jack ""Fritz"" Von Erich, is pushing his youngest brother Mike away from his musical ambitions. Their brother David makes his wrestling debut with Kevin in a tag-team match against Bruiser Brody and Gino Hernandez, where Kevin meets and starts a relationship with a woman named Pam. He tells her about the ""Von Erich curse"" that killed his oldest brother Jack Jr. as a child, supposedly brought on by Fritz changing his last name from Adkisson to his mother's, whose family had suffered constant tragedy.
Kevin fights world champion Harley Race to put himself in the lead for the championship contender, but he is brutally beaten and only wins when Race attacks the referee and is disqualified. A disappointed Fritz is delighted when David displays a natural talent for showmanship while trashing Race. The 1980 Summer Olympics boycott dashes Von Erich brother Kerry's hopes of competition, so he moves back home. Fritz presses him to fight alongside Kevin and David, while Pam helps the boys sneak Mike out to play a gig against his parents' wishes.
By 1983, the trio defeats the Fabulous Freebirds for the six man tag team championship title, and Fritz volunteers David over Kevin to fight current world champion Ric Flair. Kevin and Pam get married, and he reveals at the wedding to an ill David that he will soon be a father. A week before the match, David, while touring in Japan, dies of enteritis. Both Kevin and Kerry volunteer to fight Flair in his place, and Kerry is chosen by a coin flip, beating Flair and winning the title. Still despondent, he goes out for a motorcycle ride and loses his right foot in an accident.
Kevin begins training Mike, who badly injures his shoulder during a match and goes into a toxic shock-induced coma during surgery. Fearing the curse, Kevin has his newborn son, Ross, legally surnamed Adkisson. Mike narrowly emerges from his coma with noticeable brain damage, but when Fritz presses him to get back in the ring, he takes his own life and Kevin starts to distance himself from Pam and Ross. Despite being grief-stricken, Kevin nonetheless fights Flair for the championship but is disqualified when he ignores the referee and grapples Flair with the signature Von Erich ""Iron Claw"" move for too long.
Kerry remains the only Von Erich wrestling with his new prosthetic foot, while Fritz has given Kevin the task of running the WCCW as he focuses on life with Pam, Ross, and newest son Marshall. Kerry gives Fritz a new gun for Christmas, but becomes upset when he puts it away instead of firing it, later calling Kevin and telling him that the curse's constant presence has made him consider suicide. He hangs up before Kevin can learn his location. After calling Fritz for help, Kevin arrives at the Von Erich house the next morning just in time to hear Kerry commit suicide with the gun, and he briefly strangles Fritz in a rage. Sitting with his brother's body, Kevin has a vision of his brothers in the afterlife: Kerry leaves behind the coin that decided he would face Flair and reunites with Mike (carrying his guitar), David (wearing the champion belt), and Jack Jr. (appearing as the small boy he was at the time of his death).
Sometime later, Kevin sells the WCCW to Jerry Jarrett. His mother gives up her housewife duties for her hobby of painting, and Pam is pregnant again. Kevin weeps while watching his sons play football, telling them he misses having brothers when they try to comfort him. They promise to be brothers to him, and he gets up and plays with them.
A textual epilogue reveals that the Von Erichs were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009, and Kevin and Pam bought a ranch in Hawaii, where their large family lives to this day.
